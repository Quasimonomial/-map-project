I walked down the river about \u00be of a mile and scelected a place near the river bank unperceived by the Indians for a cash, which I set three men to make, and directed the centinel to discharge his gun if he pereceived any of the Indians going down in that direction which was to be the signal for the men at work on the cash to desist and seperate, least these people should discover our deposit and rob us of the baggage we intend leaving here. \u00a0\u00a0 by evening the cash was completed unperceived by the Indians, and all our packages made up. the Pack-saddles and harnes is not yet complete. \u00a0\u00a0 in this operation we find ourselves at a loss for nails and boards; for the first we substitute throngs of raw hide which answer verry well, and for the last to cut off the blades of our oars and use the plank of some boxes which have heretofore held other articles and put those articles into sacks of raw hide which I have had made for the purpose. \u00a0\u00a0 by this means I have obtained as many boards as will make 20 saddles which I supposed will be sufficient for our present exegencies. The Indians with us behave themselves extreemly well; the women have been busily engaged all day making and mending the mockersons of our party. In the evening the hunters returned unsuccessful. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Drouillard, George\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George\">Drewyer</a> went in search of his trap which a beaver had taken off last night; he found the beaver dead with the trap to his foot about 2 miles below the place he had set it. \u00a0\u00a0 this beaver constituted the whole of the game taken today. \u00a0\u00a0 the fur of this animal is as good as I ever saw any, and beleive that they are never out of season on the upper part of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Missouri River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Missouri%20River\">Missouri</a> and it's branches within the Mountains. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Goodrich, Silas\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Goodrich%2C%20Silas\">Goodrich</a> caught several douzen fine trout today. I made up a small assortment of medicines, together with the specemines of plants, minerals, seeds &amp;c. which, I have collected betwen this place and the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Missouri River, Great Falls of the\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Missouri%20River%2C%20Great%20Falls%20of%20the\">falls of the Missouri</a> which I shall deposit here. \u00a0\u00a0 the robe woarn by the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Shoshone Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Shoshone%20Indians\">Shoshonees</a> is the same in both sexes and is loosly thrown about their sholders, and the sides at pleasure either hanging loose or drawn together with the hands, sometimes if the weather is cold they confine it with a girdel arround the waist; they are generally about the size of a 2\u00bd point blanket <a href=\"#n20082001\" id=\"ln20082001\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> for a grown persons and reach as low as the middle of the leg. \u00a0\u00a0 this robe forms a garment in the day and constitutes their only covering at night. \u00a0\u00a0 with these people the robe is formed most commonly of the skins of Antelope, Bighorn, or deer, dressed with the hair on, tho' they prefer the buffaloe when they can procure them. I have also observed some robes among them of beaver, moonax, <a href=\"#n20082002\" id=\"ln20082002\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> and small wolves. \u00a0\u00a0 the summer robes of both sexes are also frequently made of the Elk's skin dressed without the hair. The shirt of the men is really a commodious and decent garment. \u00a0\u00a0 it roomy and reaches nearly half way the thye, there is no collar, the apperture being sufficiently large to admit the head and is left square at top, or most frequently, both before and behind terminate in the tails of the animals which they are made and which foald outwards being frequently left entire or somtimes cut into a fring on the edges and ornimented with the quills of the Porcupine. <a href=\"#n20082003\" id=\"ln20082003\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 the sides of the shirt are sewed deeply fringed, and ornamented in a similar manner from the bottom upwards, within six or eight inches of the sleve from whence it is left open as well as the sleve on it's under side to the elbow nearly. \u00a0\u00a0 from the elbow the sleve fits the arm tight as low as the wrist and is not ornimented with a fringe as the sides and under parts of the sleve are above the elbow. \u00a0\u00a0 the sholder straps are wide and on them is generally displayed the taste of the manufacterer in a variety of figures wrought with the quills of the porcupine of several colours; beads when they have them are also displayed on this part. \u00a0\u00a0 the tail of the shirt is left in the form which the fore legs and neck give it with the addition of a slight fringe. \u00a0\u00a0 the hair is usually left on the tail, &amp; near the hoofs of the animal; part of the hoof is also retained to the skin and is split into a fring by way of orniment. \u00a0\u00a0 these shirts are generally made of deer's Antelope's, Bighorn's, or Elk's skins dressed without the hair. \u00a0\u00a0 the Elk skin is less used for this purpose than either of the others. \u00a0\u00a0 their only thread used on this or any other occasion is the sinews taken from the back and loins of the deer Elk buffaloe &amp;c. Their legings are most usually formed of the skins of the Antelope dressed without the hair. \u00a0\u00a0 in the men they are very long and full each leging being formed of a skin nearly entire. \u00a0\u00a0 the legs, tail and neck are also left on these, and the tail woarn upwards; and the neck deeply fringed and ornimented with porcupine qulls drags or trails on the ground behind the heel. \u00a0\u00a0 the skin is sewn in such manner as to fit the leg and thye closely; the upper part being left open a sufficient distance to permit the legs of the skin to be dran underneath a girdle both before and behind, and the wide part of the skin to cover the buttock and lap before in such manner that the breechcloth is unnecessary. \u00a0\u00a0 they are much more decent in concealing those parts than any nation on the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Missouri River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Missouri%20River\">Missouri</a> \u00a0\u00a0 the sides of the legings are also deeply fringed and ornimented. \u00a0\u00a0 sometimes this part is ornimented with little fassicles of the hair of an enimy whom they have slain in battle. The tippet of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Shoshone Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Shoshone%20Indians\">Snake</a> Indians is the most eligant peice of Indian dress I ever saw, the neck or collar of this is formed of a strip of dressed Otter skin with the fur. \u00a0\u00a0 it is about four or five inches wide and is cut out of the back of the skin the nose and eyes forming one extremity and the tail the other. \u00a0\u00a0 beginning a little behind the ear of the animal at one edge of this collar and proceeding towards the tail, they attatch from one to two hundred and fifty little roles of Ermin skin formed in the following manner. the skin is first dressed with the fur on it and a narrow strip is cut out of the back of the skin reaching from the nose and imbracing the tail. \u00a0\u00a0 this is sewed arround a small cord of the silk-grass <a href=\"#n20082004\" id=\"ln20082004\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> twisted for the purpose and regularly tapering in such manner as to give it ajust proportion to the tail which is to form the lower extremity of the stran. \u00a0\u00a0 thus arranged they are confined at the upper point in little bundles of two\u2014three, or more as the disign may be to make them more full; these are then attatched to the collars as before mentioned, and to conceal the connection of this part which would otherwise have a course appearance they attatch a broad fringe of the Ermin skin to the collar overlaying that part. \u00a0\u00a0 little bundles of fine fringe of the same materials is fastened to the extremity of the tails in order to shew their black extremities to greater advantage. the center of the otterskin collar is also ornamented with the shells of the perl oister. \u00a0\u00a0 the collar is confined arond the neck and the little roles of Ermin skin about the size of a large quill covers the solders and body nearly to the waist and has the appearance of a short cloak and is really handsome. \u00a0\u00a0 these they esteem very highly, and give or dispose of only on important occasions. \u00a0\u00a0 the ermin whic is known to the traiders of the N. W. by the name of the white weasel is the genuine ermine, and might no doubt be turned to great advantage by those people if they would encourage the Indians to take them. \u00a0\u00a0 they are no doubt extreemly plenty and readily taken, from the number of these tippets which I have seen among these people and the great number of skins employed in the construction of each timppet. \u00a0\u00a0 scarcely any of them have employed less than one hundred of these skins in their formation.\u2014 <a href=\"#n20082005\" id=\"ln20082005\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[5]</sup></a> This morning <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt. Clark</a> set out at 6 in the morning and soon after arrived near their camp they having removed about 2 miles higher up the river than the camp at which they were when I first visited them. \u00a0\u00a0 the chief requested a halt, which was complyed with, and a number of the indians came out from the village and joined them \u00a0\u00a0 after smoking a few pipes with them they all proceeded to the village where <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt C.</a> was conducted to a large lodge prepared in the center of the encampment for himself and party. \u00a0\u00a0 here they gave him one salmon and some cakes of dryed berries. \u00a0\u00a0 he now repeated to them what had been said to them in council at this place which was repeated to the village by the Cheif. \u00a0\u00a0 when he had concluded this address he requested a guide to accompany him down the river and an elderly man was pointed out by the Cheif who consented to undertake this task. <a href=\"#n20082006\" id=\"ln20082006\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[6]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 this was the old man of whom <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Cameahwait\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Cameahwait\">Cameahwait</a> had spoken as a person well acquainted with the country to the North of this river. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt.

M. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt.

They are the poorest and most miserable nation I ever beheld; having scarcely any thing to subsist on, except berries and a few fish, which they contrive by some means, to take. They have a great many fine horses, and nothing more; and on account of these they are much harassed by other nations. They move about in any direction where the berries are most plenty. We had a long talk with them, and they gave us very unfavourable accounts with respect to the rivers.
