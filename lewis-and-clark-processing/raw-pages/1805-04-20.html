we determined to set out and accordingly departed a little before seven.

I have never heard of any instances of human sacrefices on those occasions among them.\u2014</p>\n               <p>\nThe wind blew so hard that I concluded it was impossible fror the perogues and canoes to proceed and therefore returned and joined them about three in the evening. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt.

those which were wet we put out to dry and determined to remain untill the next morning. <a href=\"#n11042005\" id=\"ln11042005\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[5]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 we sent out four hunters who soon added 3 Elk 4 gees and 2 deer to our stock of provisions. <a href=\"#n11042006\" id=\"ln11042006\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[6]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 the party caught six beaver today which were large and in fine order. \u00a0\u00a0 the Buffaloe, Elk and deer are poor at this season, and of cours are not very palitable, however our good health and apetites make up every necessary deficiency, and we eat very heartily of them.\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 encamped on Stard side;
