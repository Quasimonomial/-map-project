This morning early I dispatched two hunters to kill some meat if possible before the Indians arrive; <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Drouillard, George\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George\">Drewyer</a> I sent with the horse into the cove for that purpose. The party pursued their several occupations as yesterday. \u00a0\u00a0 by evening I had all the baggage, saddles, and harness completely ready for a march. \u00a0\u00a0 after dark, I made the men take the baggage to the cash and deposit it. I beleve we have been unperceived by the Indians in this movement. \u00a0\u00a0 notwithstanding the coldness of the last night the day has proved excessively warm. \u00a0\u00a0 neither of the hunters returned this evening and I was obliged to issue pork and corn. The mockersons of both sexes are usually the same and are made of deer Elk or buffaloe skin dressed without the hair. \u00a0\u00a0 sometimes in the winter they make them of buffaloe skin dressed with the hair on and turn the hair inwards as the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Mandan Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Mandan%20Indians\">Mandans</a>\n                  <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Hidatsa Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Hidatsa%20Indians\">Minetares</a> and most of the nations do who inhabit the buffaloe country. \u00a0\u00a0 the mockerson is formed with one seem on the outer edge of the foot is cut open at the instep to admit <em class=\"hi\">the foot and sewed up behind. in this rispect they are the same with the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Mandan Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Mandan%20Indians\">Mandans</a>.</em> they sometimes ornament their mockersons with various figures wrought with the quills of the Porcupine. some of the dressey young men orniment the tops of their mockersons with the skins of polecats <a href=\"#n21082101\" id=\"ln21082101\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> and trale the tail of that animal on the ground at their heels as they walk.\u2014 the robe of the woman is generally smaller than that of the man but is woarn in the same manner over the sholders. \u00a0\u00a0 the Chemise is roomy and comes down below the middle of the leg \u00a0\u00a0 the upper part of this garment is formed much like the shirt of the men except the sholder strap which is never used with the Chemise. \u00a0\u00a0 in women who give suck, they are left open at the sides nearly as low as the waist, in others, close as high as the sleeve. \u00a0\u00a0 the sleeve underneath as low as the elbow is open, that \u2329upper\u232a part being left very full. \u00a0\u00a0 the sides tail and upper part of the sleeves are deeply fringed and sometimes ornimented in a similar manner with the shirts of the men with the addition of little patches of red cloth about the tail edged around with beads. \u00a0\u00a0 the breast is usually ornament with various figures of party colours rought with the quills of the Porcupine. \u00a0\u00a0 it is on this part of the garment that they appear to exert their greatest ingenuity. \u00a0\u00a0 a girdle of dressed leather confines the Chemise around the waist. \u00a0\u00a0 when either the man or woman wish to disengage their arm from the sleeve they draw it out by means of the opening underneath the arm an throw the sleeve behind the body. \u00a0\u00a0 the legings of the women reach as high as the knee and are confined with a garter below. \u00a0\u00a0 the mockerson covers and confins it's lower extremity. \u00a0\u00a0 they are neither fringed nor ornamented. \u00a0\u00a0 these legings are made of the skins of the antelope and the Chemise usually of those of the large deer Bighorn and the smallest elk.\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 They seldom wear the beads they possess about their necks at least I have never seen a grown person of either sex wear them on this part; some their children are seen with them in this way. \u00a0\u00a0 the men and women were them suspen from the ear in little bunches or intermixed with triangular peices of the shells of the perl oister. \u00a0\u00a0 the men also were them attached in a similar manner to the hare of the fore part of the crown of the head; to which they sometimes make the addition of the wings and tails of birds. \u00a0\u00a0 the nose in neither sex is pierced nor do they wear any ornament in it. \u00a0\u00a0 they have a variety of small sea shells of which they form collars woarn indiscriminately by both sexes. \u00a0\u00a0 these as well as the shell of the perl oister they value very highly and inform us that they obtain them from their friends and relations who live beyond the barren plain towards the Ocean in a S. Westerly direction. <a href=\"#n21082102\" id=\"ln21082102\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 these friends of theirs they say inhabit a good country abounding with Elk, deer, bear, and Antelope, and possess a much greater number of horses and mules than they do themselves; or using their own figure that their horses and mules are as numerous as the grass of the plains. \u00a0\u00a0 the warriors or such as esteem themselves brave men wear collars made of the claws of the brown bear which are also esteemed of great value and are preserved with great care. \u00a0\u00a0 these claws are ornamented with beads about the thick end near which they are peirced through their sides and strung on a throng of dressed leather and tyed about the neck commonly with the upper edge of the tallon next the breast or neck but sometimes are reversed. \u00a0\u00a0 it is esteemed by them an act of equal celebrity the killing one of these bear or an enimy, and with the means they have of killing this animal it must really be a serious undertaking. \u00a0\u00a0 the sweet sented grass <a href=\"#n21082103\" id=\"ln21082103\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> which grows very abundant on this river is either twisted or plaited and woarn around the neck in ether sex, but most commonly by the men. \u00a0\u00a0 they have a collar also woarn by either sex. \u00a0\u00a0 it generally round and about the size of a man's finger; formed of leather or silk-grass twisted or firmly rolled and covered with the quills of the porcupine of different colours. \u00a0\u00a0 the tusks of the Elk are pierced strung on a throng and woarn as an orniment for the neck, and is most generally woarn by the women and children. \u00a0\u00a0 the men frequently wear the skin of a fox <a href=\"#n21082104\" id=\"ln21082104\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> or a broad strip of that of the otter around the forehead and head in form of a bando. \u00a0\u00a0 they are also fond of the feathers of the tail of the beautifull eagle or callumet bird <a href=\"#n21082105\" id=\"ln21082105\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[5]</sup></a> with which they ornament their own hair and the tails and mains of their horses. [<em class=\"hi\">X: also a collar of round bones which look like the joints of a fishes back</em>] The dress of these people is quite as desent and convenient as that of any nation of Indians I ever saw.</p>\n               <p>\nThis morning early <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt. C.</a> resumed his march; at the distance of five miles he arrived at some brush lodges of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Shoshone Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Shoshone%20Indians\">Shoshones</a> inhabited by about seven families \u00a0\u00a0 here he halted and was very friendly received by these people, who gave himself and party as much boiled salmon as they could eat; they also gave him several dryed salmon and a considerable quantity of dryed chokecherries. \u00a0\u00a0 after smoking with them he visited their fish wear which was abut 200 yds. distant. \u00a0\u00a0 he found the wear extended across four channels of the river which was here divided by three small islands. <a href=\"#n21082106\" id=\"ln21082106\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[6]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 three of these channels were narrow, and were stoped by means of trees fallen across, supported by which stakes of willow were driven down sufficiently near each other to prevent the salmon from passing. \u00a0\u00a0 about the center of each a cilindric basket of eighteen or 20 feet in length terminating in a conic shape at it's lower extremity, formed of willows, was opposed to a small apperture in the wear with it's mouth up stream to receive the fish. \u00a0\u00a0 the main channel of the water was conducted to this basket, which was so narrow at it's lower extremity that the fish when once in could not turn itself about, and were taken out by untying the small ends of the longitudinal willows, which frormed the hull of the basket. \u00a0\u00a0 the wear in the main channel was somewhat differently contrived. \u00a0\u00a0 there were two distinct wears formed of poles and willow sticks, quite across the river, at no great distance from each other. \u00a0\u00a0 each of these, were furnished with two baskets; the one wear to take them ascending and the other in decending. \u00a0\u00a0 in constructing these wears, poles were first tyed together in parcels of three near the smaller extremity; these were set on end, and spread in a triangular form at the base, in such manner, that two of the three poles ranged in the direction of the intended work, and the third down the stream. \u00a0\u00a0 two ranges of horizontal poles were next lashed with willow bark and wythes to the ranging poles, and on these willow sticks were placed perpendicularly, reaching from the bottom of the river to about 3 or four feet above it's surface; and placed so near each other, as not to permit the passage of the fish, and even so thick in some parts, as with the help of gravel and stone to give a direction to the water which they wished.\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 the baskets were the same in form of the others. \u00a0\u00a0 this is the form of the work, and disposition of the baskets. <a href=\"#n21082107\" id=\"ln21082107\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[7]</sup></a>\n               </p>\n               <p>\n                 <div class=\"tei_figure\"><div class=\"figure_image\"><a href=\"https://cdrhmedia.unl.edu/images/lewisandclark/full/1805-08-21.01.jpg\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" data-gallery=\"LC\" data-title=\"\"><img src=\"https://cdrhmedia.unl.edu/images/lewisandclark/300/1805-08-21.01.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></a></div>\n                     <div class=\"p\">\n                        <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Shoshone Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Shoshone%20Indians\">Shoshone</a> Fish Weir, August 21, 1805, Codex F, p. 147\n<div class=\"tei_bibl\">\n                           <span class=\"tei_orgName\">(American Philosophical Society library, </span>\n                           <div class=\"note\"> used with permission.)</div>\n                        </div>\n                     </div>\n                  </div>\n               </p>\n               <p>\nAfter examining the wears <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt.
