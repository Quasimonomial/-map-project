M. when it ceased, the air keen and cold, the snow 8 inches deep on the plain; we collected our horses and after taking a scant breakfast of roots we set out for the village of <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Broken Arm\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Broken%20Arm\">Tunnachemootoolt</a>; our rout lay through an open plain course S. 35 E. and distance 16 ms. \u00a0\u00a0 the road was slippery and the snow clogged to the horses feet, and caused them to trip frequently. \u00a0\u00a0 the mud at the sources of the little ravines was deep black <a href=\"#n34051001\" id=\"ln34051001\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> and well supplyed with quawmash. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Drouillard, George\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George\">Drewyer</a> turned off to the left of the road in order to hunt and did not join us this evening. \u00a0\u00a0 at 4 in the afternoon we decended the hills to <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Lawyer (Commearp) Creek\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Lawyer%20%28Commearp%29%20Creek\">Commearp Creek</a> and arrived at the Village of <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Broken Arm\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Broken%20Arm\">Tunnachemootoolt</a>, <a href=\"#n34051002\" id=\"ln34051002\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> the cheeif at whos lodge we had left a flag last fall. \u00a0\u00a0 this flag was now displayed on a staff placed at no great distance from the lodge. underneath the flag the Cheif met my friend <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt. C.</a> who was in front and conducted him about 80 yds. to a place on the bank of the creek where he requested we should encamp; I came up in a few minutes and we collected the Cheifs and men of consideration smoked with them and stated our situation with rispect to provision. \u00a0\u00a0 the Cheif spoke to his people and they produced us about 2 bushels of the Quawmas roots dryed, four cakes of the bread of <em class=\"hi\">cows</em> and a dryed salmon trout. <a href=\"#n34051003\" id=\"ln34051003\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> We thanked them for this store of provision but informed them that our men not being accustomed to live on roots alone we feared it would make them sick, to obviate which we proposed exchangeing a good horse in reather low order for a young horse in tolerable order with a view to kill. \u00a0\u00a0 the hospitality of the cheif revolted at the aydea of an exchange, he told us that his young men had a great abundance of young horses and if we wished to eat them we should by furnished with as many as we wanted. \u00a0\u00a0 accordingly they soon produced us two fat young horses one of which we killed, the other we informed them we would pospone killing untill we had consumed the one already killed. This is a much greater act of hospitality than we have witnessed from any nation or tribe since we have passed the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Rocky Mountains\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains\">Rocky mountains</a>. \u00a0\u00a0 in short be it spoken to their immortal honor it is the only act which deserves the appellation of hospitallity which we have witnessed in this quarter. <a href=\"#n34051004\" id=\"ln34051004\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 we informed these people that we were hungry and fatiegued at this moment, that when we had eaten and refreshed ourselves we would inform them who we were, from whence we had come and the objects of our resurches. \u00a0\u00a0 a principal Cheif by name <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Hohots Ilppilp\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Hohots%20Ilppilp\">Ho-h\u00e2st,-ill-pilp</a>\n                   <a href=\"#n34051005\" id=\"ln34051005\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[5]</sup></a> arrived with a party of fifty men mounted on eligant horses. \u00a0\u00a0 he had come on a visit to us from his village which is situated about six miles distant near the river. \u00a0\u00a0 we invited this man into our circle and smoked with him, his retinue continued on horseback at a little distance. \u00a0\u00a0 after we had eaten a few roots we spoke to them as we had promised; and gave <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Broken Arm\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Broken%20Arm\">Tinnachemootoolt</a> and <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Hohots Ilppilp\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Hohots%20Ilppilp\">Hoh\u00e2stillpilp</a> each a medal; the former one of the small size with the likeness of Mr. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Jefferson, Thomas\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas\">Jefferson</a> and the latter one of the sewing medals struck in the presidency of <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Washington, George\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Washington%2C%20George\">Washington</a>, <a href=\"#n34051006\" id=\"ln34051006\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[6]</sup></a> we explained to them the desighn and the importance of medals in the estimation of the whites as well as the red men who had been taught their value. The Cheif had a large conic lodge of leather <a href=\"#n34051007\" id=\"ln34051007\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[7]</sup></a> erected for our reception and a parsel of wood collected and laid at the door after which he invited <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt. C.</a> and myself to make that lodge our home while we remained with him. \u00a0\u00a0 we had a fire lighted in this lodge and retired to it accompanyed by the Cheifs and as many of the considerate men as could croud in a circcle within it. \u00a0\u00a0 here after we had taken a repast on some horsebeef we resumed our council with the indians which together with smoking the pipe occupyed the ballance of the evening. I was surprised to find on decending the hills of <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Lawyer (Commearp) Creek\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Lawyer%20%28Commearp%29%20Creek\">Commearp Cr.</a> to find that there had been no snow in the bottoms of that stream. \u00a0\u00a0 it seems that the snow melted in falling and decended here in rain while it snowed on the plains. \u00a0\u00a0 the hills are about six hundred feet high about one fourth of which distance the snow had decended and still lay on the sides of the hills. \u00a0\u00a0 as these people had been liberal with is with rispect to provision I directed the men not to croud their lodge surch of food in the manner hunger has compelled them to do at most lodges we have passed, and which the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Twisted Hair (Walamotinin)\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Twisted%20Hair%20%28Walamotinin%29\">Twisted hair</a> had informed me was disgreeable to the natives. \u00a0\u00a0 but their previous want of hospitality had induced us to consult their enclinations but little and suffer our men to obtain provision from them on the best terms they could. The village of the broken arm as I have heretofore termed it consists of one house only which is 150 feet in length built in the usual form of sticks matts and dry grass. \u00a0\u00a0 it contains twenty four fires and about double that number of families. \u00a0\u00a0 from appearances I presume they could raise 100 fighting men. \u00a0\u00a0 the noise of their women pounding roots reminds me of a nail factory. The indians seem well pleased, and I am confident that they are not more so than our men who have their somachs once more well filled with horsebeef and mush of the bread of cows.\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 the house of coventry is also seen here.\u2014 <a href=\"#n34051008\" id=\"ln34051008\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[8]</sup></a>\n               </p>\n            </span>\n         </div>\n         <div class=\"entry lc.jrn.1806-05-10.02 tei_div\" id=\"lc.jrn.1806-05-10.02\">\n            <span class=\"tei_sp_who_wc tei_sp\">\n               <h4 class=\"entry_author\">[Clark]</h4>\n               <span class=\"tei_ab\">\n                  <div class=\"entry_date\">\n                     <em class=\"hi\">Saturday 10th of May 1806</em>\n                  </div><div class=\"clear_return\">\u00a0</div>\n               </span>\n               <p>\nThis morning the Snow continued falling untill \u00bd past 6 A M when it Seased. \u00a0\u00a0 the air keen and Cold the Snow 8 inches deep on the plain. \u00a0\u00a0 we Collected our horses and after takeing a Scanty brackfast of roots, we Set out for the Village of the Chief with a flag, and proceeded on through an open plain. \u00a0\u00a0 the road was Slipry and the Snow Cloged and caused the horses to trip very frequently. \u00a0\u00a0 the mud at heads of the Streams which we passed was deep and well Supplied with the <em class=\"hi\">Car mash.</em>\n                   <a href=\"#n34051009\" id=\"ln34051009\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[9]</sup></a>\n                  <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Drouillard, George\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George\">Drewyer</a> turned off the road to hunt near the river to our lef and did not join us today. \u00a0\u00a0 at 4 P M we arrived at the Village of <em class=\"hi\">\n                     <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Broken Arm\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Broken%20Arm\">Tin nach-e-moo-toolt</a>\n                  </em>\n                   <a href=\"#n34051010\" id=\"ln34051010\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[10]</sup></a> the Chief whome We had left a flag. \u00a0\u00a0 this flag was hoisted on a pole \u00a0\u00a0 unde the flag the Chief met me and Conducted me to a Spot near a Small run about 80 paces from his Lodges here he requested me to halt which I did.

Without breakfast we started to go to a village of the natives, who live on a branch of the river, about a south course from this place. We travelled through the snow about 12 miles, and then went down a long steep descent to the branch where the village is situated. When we were about half way down the hill there was not a particle of snow nor the least appearance of it.
