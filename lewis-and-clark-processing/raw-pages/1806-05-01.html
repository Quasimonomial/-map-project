I wished to obtain good information of this newly recommended tract before I could consent to leave the present road which seemed to lead us in the proper direction was level and furnished with wood and water. \u00a0\u00a0 when the guide arrived he seemed much displeased with the other, he assured us that the rout up the creek was the nearest, and much the best, that if we took the other we would be obliged to remain here untill tomorrow morning, and then travel a whole day before we could reach water, and that there was no wood; the other agreed that this was the case. \u00a0\u00a0 we therefore did not hesitate to pursue the rout recommended by the guide. <a href=\"#n32050101\" id=\"ln32050101\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 the creek, it's bottom lands, and the appearance of the plains were much as those of esterday only with this difference that the latter were not so sandy. \u00a0\u00a0 we had sent out four hunters this morning two on foot and 2 on horseback they joined us while we halted here. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Drouillard, George\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George\">Drewyer</a> had killed a beaver. \u00a0\u00a0 at 1 P.

We set out early and travelled up the branch, which is a fine stream about twenty yards wide, with some cottonwood, birch and willows on its banks. One of four hunters, who went forward very early this morning, returned at noon with a beaver he had killed; other game is scarce. We then halted to dine, where the road forks, one going up the branch an east course, and the other north towards the large river. <a href=\"#n32050109\" id=\"ln32050109\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[9]</sup></a> Here our Indians differed in opinion with respect to the best road to be taken. The man with the family and gang of horses said he would go across to the Great river to-morrow; but we followed the opinion of the young man our guide, and proceeded on up the creek. We travelled about twenty-five miles, and encamped without any of the natives, except our guide, who generally keeps with the hunters, one of whom <a href=\"#n32050110\" id=\"ln32050110\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[10]</sup></a> killed a deer this evening.
