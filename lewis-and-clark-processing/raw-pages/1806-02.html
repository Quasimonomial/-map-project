Sergt. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Gass, Patrick\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick\">Gass</a> with a party of five men again set out up the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Lewis and Clark (Fort, Netul) River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Lewis%20and%20Clark%20%28Fort%2C%20Netul%29%20River\">Netul river</a> in surch of the Elk which had been killed some days since, and which could not be found in consequence of the snow. The Canoes of the naives inhabiting the lower portion of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Columbia River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Columbia%20River\">Columbia River</a> make their canoes remarkably neat light and well addapted for riding high waves. I have seen the natives near the coast riding waves in these canoes with safety and apparently without concern where I should have thought it impossible for any vessel of the same size to lived a minute. \u00a0\u00a0 they are built of whitecedar or Arborvita generally, but sometimes of the firr. \u00a0\u00a0 they are cut out of a solid stick of timber, the gunwals at the upper edge foald over outwards and are about \u215d of an inch thick and 4 or five broad, and stand horrizontally forming a kind of rim to the canoe to prevent the water beating into it. \u00a0\u00a0 they are all furnished with more or less crossbars in proportion to the size of the canoe. \u00a0\u00a0 these bars are round sticks about half the size of a man's arm, which are incerted through holes \u2329just\u232a made in either side of the canoe just below the rim of the gunwall and are further secured with strings of waytape; <a href=\"#n28020101\" id=\"ln28020101\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> these crossbars serve to lift and manage the canoe on land. \u00a0\u00a0 when the natives land they invariably take their canoes on shore, unless they are heavily laden, and then even, if they remain all night, they discharge their loads and take the canoes on shore. \u00a0\u00a0 some of the large canoes are upwards of 50 feet long and will carry from 8 to 10 thousand lbs. or from 20 to thirty persons and some of them particularly on the sea coast are waxed painted and ornimented with curious images at bough and Stern; those images sometimes rise to the hight of five feet; the pedestals on which these immages are fixed are sometimes cut out of the solid stick with the canoe, and the imagary is formed of seperate small peices of timber firmly united with tenants and motices without assistance of a single spike of any kind. \u00a0\u00a0 when the natives are engaged in navigating their canoes one sets in the stern and steers with a paddle the others set by pears and paddle over the gunwall next them, they all kneel in the bottom of the canoe and set on their feet. \u00a0\u00a0 their paddles are of a uniform shape of which this is an imitation <a href=\"#n28020102\" id=\"ln28020102\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 these paddles are made very thin and the middle of the blade is thick and hollowed out siddonly and made thin at the sides while the center forms a kind of rib. \u00a0\u00a0 the blade occupys about one third of the length of the paddle which is usually from 4\u00bd to 5 feet. I have observed four forms of canoe only in uce among the nations below the grand chatarac of this river \u00a0\u00a0 they are as follows. \u00a0\u00a0 this is the smallest size <a href=\"#n28020103\" id=\"ln28020103\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> about 15 feet long and calculated for one or two persons, and are most common among the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Cathlamet Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Cathlamet%20Indians\">Cathlahmahs</a> and <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Wahkiakum Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Wahkiakum%20Indians\">W\u00e2ck ki a cums</a> among the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Marsh (Seal) Island\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Marsh%20%28Seal%29%20Island\">marshey Islands</a>. A the bow; B, the stern; these <a href=\"#n28020104\" id=\"ln28020104\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> are from twenty to thirty five feet and from two \u00bd to 3 feet in the beam and about 2 feet in the hole; this canoe is common to all the nations below the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Columbia River, Cascades (Great Rapids, Great Shute)\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Columbia%20River%2C%20Cascades%20%28Great%20Rapids%2C%20Great%20Shute%29\">grand rappids</a>. \u00a0\u00a0 it is here made deeper and shorter in proportion than they really are.\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 the bowsprit from C, to D is brought to a sharp edge tapering gradually from the sides.</p>\n               <p>\nThis is the most common form <a href=\"#n28020105\" id=\"ln28020105\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[5]</sup></a> of the canoe in uce among the Indians from; the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Wishram-Wasco Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Wishram-Wasco%20Indians\">Chil-luck-kit-te-quaw</a> inclusive to the Ocean and is usually about 30 or 35 feet long, and will carry from ten to twelve persons. \u00a0\u00a0 4 men are competent to carry them a considerable distance say a mile without resting. A is the end which they use as the bow, but which on first sight I took to be the stern \u00a0\u00a0 C. D. is a comb cut of the sollid stick with the canoe and projects from the center of the end of the canoe being about 1 inch thirck it's sides parallel and edge at C D. sharp. \u00a0\u00a0 it is from 9 to 11 Inches in length and extends from the underpart of the bowsprit at A to the bottom of the canoe at D.\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 the stern B. is mearly rounding and graduly ascending. \u00a0\u00a0 1 2 3 represents the rim of the gunwalls about 4 Inches wide, reather ascending as they recede from the canoe. \u00a0\u00a0 4 5 6 7 8 are the round holes through which the cross bars are inserted.\u2014</p>\n               <p>\n                 <div class=\"tei_figure\"><div class=\"figure_image\"><a href=\"https://cdrhmedia.unl.edu/images/lewisandclark/full/1806-02-01.01.jpg\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" data-gallery=\"LC\" data-title=\"\"><img src=\"https://cdrhmedia.unl.edu/images/lewisandclark/300/1806-02-01.01.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></a></div>\n                     <div class=\"p\">Paddle, Small Canoe, Canoe with High Bow,<br/>\nand Most Common Canoe, February 1, 1806, Codex J, p. 52\n<div class=\"tei_bibl\">\n                           <span class=\"tei_orgName\">(American Philosophical Society library, </span>\n                           <div class=\"note\"> used with permission.)</div>\n                        </div>\n                     </div>\n                  </div>\n               </p>\n               <p>\nThis form of canoe <a href=\"#n28020106\" id=\"ln28020106\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[6]</sup></a> we did not meet with untill we reached tidewater or below the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Columbia River, Cascades (Great Rapids, Great Shute)\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Columbia%20River%2C%20Cascades%20%28Great%20Rapids%2C%20Great%20Shute%29\">grand rappids</a>. \u00a0\u00a0 from thence down it is common to all the nations but more particularly the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Tillamook Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Tillamook%20Indians\">Killamucks</a> and others of the coast. these are the largest canoes.
