M. our usual tme of halting. \u00a0\u00a0 by this means I acquired leasure to accomplish some wrightings which I conceived from the nature of my instructions necessary lest any accedent should befall me on the long and reather hazardous rout I was now about to take. <a href=\"#n18080901\" id=\"ln18080901\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 the party did not arrive and I returned about a mile and met them, here they halted and we breakefasted; I had killed two fine gees on my return. \u00a0\u00a0 while we halted here <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Shannon, George\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Shannon%2C%20George\">Shannon</a> arrived, and informed us that having missed the party the day on which he set out he had returned the next morning to the place from whence he had set out or furst left them and not finding that he had supposed that they wer above him; that he then set out and marched one day up wisdom river, by which time he was convinced that they were not above him as the river could not be navigated; he then returned to the forks and had pursued us up this river. \u00a0\u00a0 he brought the skins of three deer which he had killed which he said were in good order. he had lived very plentifully this trip but looked a good deel worried <a href=\"#n18080902\" id=\"ln18080902\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> with his march. \u00a0\u00a0 he informed us that <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Big Hole (Sensable, Wisdom) River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Big%20Hole%20%28Sensable%2C%20Wisdom%29%20River\">Wisdom river</a> still kept it's course obliquely down <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Beaverhead (Jefferson) River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Beaverhead%20%28Jefferson%29%20River\">the Jefferson's river</a> as far as he was up it. \u00a0\u00a0 immediately after breakfast I slung my pack and set out accompanyed by <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Drouillard, George\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George\">Drewyer</a>\n                  <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Shields, John\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Shields%2C%20John\">Shields</a> and <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"McNeal, Hugh\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=McNeal%2C%20Hugh\">McNeal</a> who had been previously directed to hold themselves in readiness for this service.
