on enquiry it appeared that he had neglected to confine them to picquts as had been directed last evening. \u00a0\u00a0 we immediately dispatched <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Field, Reubin\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Field%2C%20Reubin\">Reubin Feilds</a> and <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Labiche, Fran\u00e7ois\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Labiche%2C%20Fran%C3%A7ois\">Labuish</a> to assist <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Charbonneau, Toussaint\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Charbonneau%2C%20Toussaint\">Charbono</a> in recovering his horses. \u00a0\u00a0 one of them was found at no great distance and the other was given over as lost. \u00a0\u00a0 at 8 A.

we therefore determined to proceed immediately to the next village which from the information of our guide will occupy the greater part of the day to reach \u00a0\u00a0 at eleven OCk. we loaded our horses and set out. \u00a0\u00a0 during the time we were detained this morning we had two packsaddles made. \u00a0\u00a0 we continued our march along a narrow rocky bottom on the N. side of the river about 12 miles to the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Tenino Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Tenino%20Indians\">Wah-how-pum</a> Village <a href=\"#n32042301\" id=\"ln32042301\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> of 12 temperary mat lodges near the Rock rapid. \u00a0\u00a0 these people appeared much pleased to see us, sold us 4 dogs and some wood for our small articles which we had previously prepared as our only resource to obtain fuel and food through those plains. \u00a0\u00a0 these articles conisted of pewter buttons, strips of tin iron and brass, twisted wire &amp;c. \u00a0\u00a0 we also obtained some shap-le-lell newly made from these people. \u00a0\u00a0 here we met with a <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Nez Perce Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians\">Chopunnish</a> man on his return up the river with his family and about 13 head of horses most of them young and unbroken.\u00a0\u00a0  he offered to hire us some of them to pack as far a his nation, but we prefer bying as by hireing his horses we shal have the whole of his family most probably to mentain. \u00a0\u00a0 at a little distance below this village we passed five lodges of the same people who like those were waiting the arrival of the salmon. \u00a0\u00a0 after we had arranged our camp we caused all the old and brave men to set arround and smoke with us. \u00a0\u00a0 we had the violin played and some of the men danced; after which the natives entertained us with a dance after their method. <a href=\"#n32042302\" id=\"ln32042302\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 this dance differed from any I have yet seen. \u00a0\u00a0 they formed a circle and all sung as well the spectators as the dancers who performed within the circle. these placed their sholders together with their robes tightly drawn about them and danced in a line from side to side, several parties of from 4 to seven will be performing within the circle at the same time. \u00a0\u00a0 the whole concluded with a premiscuous dance in which most of them sung and danced. \u00a0\u00a0 these people speak a language very similar to the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Nez Perce Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians\">Chopunnish</a> whome they also resemble in their dress \u00a0\u00a0 their women wear long legings mockersons shirts and robes. \u00a0\u00a0 their men also dress with legings shirts robes and mockersons. \u00a0\u00a0 after the dance was ended the indians retired at our request and we retired to rest. \u00a0\u00a0 we had all our horses side hubbled and turned out to graize; at this village, a large creek <a href=\"#n32042303\" id=\"ln32042303\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> falls in on the N. side which we did not observe as we decended the river. \u00a0\u00a0 the river is by no means as rapid as when we decended or at least not obstructed with those dangerous rapids \u00a0\u00a0 the water at present covers most of the rocks in the bed of the river. \u00a0\u00a0 the natives promised to barter their horses with us in the morning we therefore entertained a hope that we shall be enabled to proceede by land from hence with the whole of our party and baggage. \u00a0\u00a0 came 12 miles by land. \u00a0\u00a0 the sands made the march fatieguing.\u2014\n</p>\n            </span>\n         </div>\n         <div class=\"entry lc.jrn.1806-04-23.02 tei_div\" id=\"lc.jrn.1806-04-23.02\">\n            <span class=\"tei_sp_who_wc tei_sp\">\n               <h4 class=\"entry_author\">[Clark]</h4>\n               <span class=\"tei_ab\">\n                  <div class=\"entry_date\">\n                     <em class=\"hi\">Wednesday 23rd 1806</em>\n                      <a href=\"#n32042304\" id=\"ln32042304\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[4]</sup></a>\n                  </div><div class=\"clear_return\">\u00a0</div>\n               </span>\n               <p>\nat day light this morning we were informed that the two horses of our interpreter <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Charbonneau, Toussaint\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Charbonneau%2C%20Toussaint\">Shabono</a> were missing \u00a0\u00a0 on enquirey we were informed that he had neglected to tie up his horses as derected last evening. \u00a0\u00a0 we imedeately dispatch him, <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Field, Reubin\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Field%2C%20Reubin\">R.
