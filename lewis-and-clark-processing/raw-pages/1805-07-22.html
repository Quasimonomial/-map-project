The river being divided into such a number of channels by both large and small Island that I found it impossible to lay it down correctly following one channel only in a canoe and therefore walked on shore took the general courses of the river and from the rising grounds took a view of the Islands and it's different channels which I laid don in conformity thereto on my chart. \u00a0\u00a0 there being but little timber to obstruct my view I could see it's various meanders very satisfactorily. I passed though a large island which I found a beautifull level and fertile plain about 10 feet above the surface of the water and never overflown. \u00a0\u00a0 on this Island I [<em class=\"hi\">NB: We</em>] met with great quantities of a smal onion <a href=\"#n17072201\" id=\"ln17072201\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> about the size of a musquit ball and some even larger; they were white crisp and well flavored \u00a0\u00a0 I geathered about half a bushel of them before the canoes arrived. I halted the party for breakfast and the men also geathered considerable quantities of those onions. \u00a0\u00a0 it's seed had just arrived to maturity and I gathered a good quantity of it. This appears to be a valuable plant inasmuch as it produces a large quantity to the squar foot and bears with ease the rigor of this climate, and withall I think it as pleasantly flavored as any species of that root I ever tasted. I called this beatifull and fertile island after this plant <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Onion Island\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Onion%20Island\">Onion Island</a>. \u00a0\u00a0 here I passed over to the stard. shore where the country was higher and ascended the river to the entrance of a large creek which discharges itself into the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Missouri River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Missouri%20River\">Missouri</a> on the Stard. side. \u00a0\u00a0 it is composed of three pretty considerable creeks which unite in a beautifull and extensive vally a few miles before it discharges itself into the river. <a href=\"#n17072202\" id=\"ln17072202\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 while wateing for the canoes to arrive I killed an otter which sunk to the bottom on being shot, a circumstance unusual with that anamal. \u00a0\u00a0 the water was about 8 feet deep yet so clear that I could see it at the bottom; I swam in and obtained it by diving. I halted the party here for dinner; the canoes had taken different channels through these islands and it was sometime before they all came up. I placed my thermometer in a good shade as was my custom about 4 P. M. and after dinner set out without it and had proceeded near a mile before I recollected it \u00a0\u00a0 I sent <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Ordway, John\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Ordway%2C%20John\">Sergt. Ordway</a> back for it, he found it and brought it on. \u00a0\u00a0 the murcury stood at 80 a. 0 \u00a0\u00a0 this is the warmest day except one which we have experienced this summer. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Sacagawea\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Sacagawea\">The Indian woman</a> recognizes the country and assures us that this is the river on which her relations live, and that the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Beaver (White Paint, White Earth, Pryor's Valley) Creek (Broadwater County, Mont.)\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Beaver%20%28White%20Paint%2C%20White%20Earth%2C%20Pryor%27s%20Valley%29%20Creek%20%28Broadwater%20County%2C%20Mont.%29\">three forks</a> are at no great distance. \u00a0\u00a0 this peice of information has cheered the sperits of the party who now begin to console themselves with the anticipation of shortly seeing the head of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Missouri River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Missouri%20River\">missouri</a> yet unknown to the civilized world. \u00a0\u00a0 the large creek which we passed on Stard. 15 yds. we call <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Beaver (White Paint, White Earth, Pryor's Valley) Creek (Broadwater County, Mont.)\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Beaver%20%28White%20Paint%2C%20White%20Earth%2C%20Pryor%27s%20Valley%29%20Creek%20%28Broadwater%20County%2C%20Mont.%29\">white Earth Creek</a> \u2329in honour of <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Pryor, Nathaniel Hale\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Pryor%2C%20Nathaniel%20Hale\">Sergt.
