the country much as it was yesterday with this difference that the bottoms are somewhat wider; passed some high black bluffs. \u00a0\u00a0 saw immence herds of buffaloe today also Elk deer wolves and Antelopes. \u00a0\u00a0 passed three large creeks one on the Stard. and two others on the Lard. side, <a href=\"#n13051401\" id=\"ln13051401\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> neither of which had any runing water. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt Clark</a> walked on shore and killed a very fine buffaloe cow. I felt an inclination to eat some veal and walked on shore and killed a very fine buffaloe calf and a large woolf, much the whitest I had seen, it was quite as white as the wool of the common sheep. \u00a0\u00a0 one of the party wounded a brown bear very badly, but being alone did not think proper to pursue him. In the evening the men in two of the rear canoes discovered a large brown bear lying in the open grounds about 300 paces from the river, and six of them went out to attack him, all good hunters; they took the advantage of a small eminence which concealed them and got within 40 paces of him unperceived, two of them reserved their fires as had been previously conscerted, the four others fired nearly at the same time and put each his bullet through him, two of the balls passed through the bulk of both lobes of his lungs, in an instant this monster ran at them with open mouth, the two who had reserved their fires discharged their pieces at him as he came towards them, boath of them struck him, one only slightly and the other fortunately broke his shoulder, this however only retarded his motion for a moment only, the men unable to reload their guns took to flight, the bear pursued and had very nearly overtaken them before they reached the river; two of the party betook themselves to a canoe and the others seperated an concealed themselves among the willows, reloaded their pieces, each discharged his piece at him as they had an opportunity they struck him several times again but the guns served only to direct the bear to them, in this manner he pursued two of them seperately so close that they were obliged to throw aside their guns and pouches and throw themselves into the river altho' the bank was nearly twenty feet perpendicular; so enraged was this anamal that he plunged into the river only a few feet behind the second man he had compelled take refuge in the water, when one of those who still remained on shore shot him through the head and finally killed him; they then took him on shore and butched him when they found eight balls had passed through him in different directions; the bear being old the flesh was indifferent, they therefore only took the skin and fleece, <a href=\"#n13051402\" id=\"ln13051402\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> the latter made us several gallons of oil; it was after the sun had set before these men come up with us, where we had been halted by an occurrence, which I have now to recappitulate, and which altho' happily passed without ruinous injury, I cannot recollect but with the utmost trepidation and horror; this is the upseting and narrow escape of the white perogue \u00a0\u00a0 It happened unfortunately for us this evening that <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Charbonneau, Toussaint\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Charbonneau%2C%20Toussaint\">Charbono</a> was at the helm of this Perogue, in stead of <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Drouillard, George\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George\">Drewyer</a>, who had previously steered her; <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Charbonneau, Toussaint\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Charbonneau%2C%20Toussaint\">Charbono</a> cannot swim and is perhaps the most timid waterman in the world; perhaps it was equally unluckey that <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt. C.</a> and myself were both on shore at that moment, a circumstance which rarely happened; and tho' we were on the shore opposite to the perogue, were too far distant to be heard or to do more than remain spectators of her fate; in this perogue [<em class=\"hi\">blank with apparent erasures</em>] were embarked, our papers, Instruments, books medicine, a great part of our merchandize and in short almost every article indispensibly necessary to further the views, or insure the success of the enterprize <a href=\"#n13051403\" id=\"ln13051403\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> \u2329of the expedition\u232a in which we are now launched to the distance of 2200 miles. \u00a0\u00a0 surfice it to say, that the Perogue was under sail when a sudon squawl of wind struck her obliquely, and turned her considerably, the steersman allarmed, in stead of puting her before the wind, lufted her up into it, the wind was so violent that it drew the brace of the squarsail out of the hand of the man who was attending it, and instantly upset the perogue and would have turned her completely topsaturva, had it not have been from the resistance mad by the oarning against the water; in this situation <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt. C</a> and myself both fired our guns to attract the attention if possible of the crew and ordered the halyards to be cut and the sail hawled in, but they did not hear us; such was their confusion and consternation at this moment, that they suffered the perogue to lye on her side for half a minute before they took the sail in, the perogue then wrighted but had filled within an inch of the gunwals; <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Charbonneau, Toussaint\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Charbonneau%2C%20Toussaint\">Charbono</a> still crying to his god for mercy, had not yet recollected the rudder, nor could the repeated orders of the Bowsman, <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Cruzatte, Pierre\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Cruzatte%2C%20Pierre\">Cruzat</a>, bring him to his recollection untill he threatend to shoot him instantly if he did not take hold of the rudder and do his duty, the waves by this time were runing very high, but the fortitude resolution and good conduct of <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Cruzatte, Pierre\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Cruzatte%2C%20Pierre\">Cruzat</a> saved her; he ordered 2 of the men to throw out the water with some kettles that fortunately were convenient, while himself and two others rowed her as[h]ore, where she arrived scarcely above the water; we now took every article out of her and lay them to drane as well as we could for the evening, baled out the canoe and secured her; there were two other men beside <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Charbonneau, Toussaint\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Charbonneau%2C%20Toussaint\">Charbono</a> on board who could not swim, and who of course must also have perished had the perogue gone to the bottom. \u00a0\u00a0 while the perogue lay on her side, finding I could not be heard, I for a moment forgot my own situation, and involluntarily droped my gun, threw aside my shot pouch and was in the act of unbuttoning my coat, before I recollected the folly of the attempt I was about to make, which was to throw myself into the river and indevour to swim to the perogue; the perogue was three hundred yard distant the waves so high that a perogue could scarcely live in any situation, the water excessively could, and the stream rappid; had I undertaken this project therefore, there was a hundred to one but what I should have paid the forfit of my life for the madness of my project, but this had the perogue been lost, I should have valued but little.\u2014 <a href=\"#n13051404\" id=\"ln13051404\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> After having all matters arranged for the evening as well as the nature of circumstances would permit, we thought it a proper occasion to console ourselves and cheer the sperits of our men and accordingly took a drink of grog and gave each man a gill of sperits.</p>\n               <div class=\"p\">\n                  <div class=\"tei_table_head\">\n
