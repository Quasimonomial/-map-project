M. all our hunters returned, <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Drouillard, George\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George\">Drewyer</a> and <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Cruzatte, Pierre\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Cruzatte%2C%20Pierre\">Cruzatte</a> brought each a deer, <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Collins, John\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Collins%2C%20John\">Collins</a> wounded another which my dogs caught at a little distance from the camp. \u00a0\u00a0 our stock of provision now consisted of 4 deer and the remnant of the horse which we killed at <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Potlatch River (Colter's Creek)\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Potlatch%20River%20%28Colter%27s%20Creek%29\">Colter's Creek</a>. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Shields, John\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Shields%2C%20John\">Sheilds</a> killed a duck [<em class=\"hi\">EC: Spatula clypeata</em>] of an uncommon kind. <a href=\"#n34050801\" id=\"ln34050801\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 the head beak and wing of which I preserved. \u00a0\u00a0 the beak is remarkably wide and obtusely pointed, on it's edges it is furnished with a sceries of teeth very long and fine not unlike the teeth of a comb. \u00a0\u00a0 the belley is of a brick red, the lower part of the neck white, the upper part or but of the wing is a sky blue, underneath which a narrow stripe of white succeeds marking the wing transversly, the large feathers are of a dark colour. \u00a0\u00a0 tail short and pointed and consists of 12 dark brown feathers. \u00a0\u00a0 the back is black and sides white; legs yellow and feet formed like the Duckinmallard which it also resembles in size and form. \u00a0\u00a0 the eye is moderately large, puple black and iris of an orrange colour. \u00a0\u00a0 the colours and appearance of the female is precisely that of the duckinmallard only, reather smaller. \u00a0\u00a0 we are informed that the natives in this quarter were much distressed for food in the course of the last winter; they were compelled to collect the moss <a href=\"#n34050802\" id=\"ln34050802\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> which grows on the pine which they boiled and eat; near this camp I observed many pine trees which appear to have been cut down about that season which they inform us was done in order to collect the seed of the longleafed pine which in those moments of distress also furnishes an article of food; the seed of this speceis of pine is about the size and much the shape of the seed of the large sunflower; they are nutricious and not unpleasent when roasted or boiled, during this month the natives also peal this pine and eat the succulent or inner bark. \u00a0\u00a0 in the creek near our encampment I observed a falling trap constructed on the same plan with those frequent seen in the atlantic states for catching the fish decending the stream <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt. C.</a> took several small trout from this trap. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Cut Nose\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Cut%20Nose\">Neesh-ne-park-kee-ook</a> and several other indians joined us this morning. \u00a0\u00a0 we gave this cheif and the indians with us some venison, horsebeef, the entrels of the four deer, and four fawns which were taken from two of the does that were killed, they eat none of their food raw, tho' the entrals had but little preperation and the fawns were boiled and consumed hair hide and entrals. \u00a0\u00a0 these people sometimes eat the flesh of the horse tho' they will in most instances suffer extreem hunger before they will kill their horses for that purpose, this seems reather to proceede from an attatchment to this animal, than a dislike to it's flesh for I observe many of them eat very heartily of the horsebeef which we give them. The <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Shoshone Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Shoshone%20Indians\">Shoshone</a> man was displeased because we did not give him as much venison as he could eat and in consequence refused to interpret, we took no further notice of him and in the course of a few hours he became very officious and seemed anxious to reinstate himself in our good opinons. \u00a0\u00a0 the relation of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Twisted Hair (Walamotinin)\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Twisted%20Hair%20%28Walamotinin%29\">twisted hair</a> and <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Cut Nose\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Cut%20Nose\">Neeshneparkkeook</a> gave us a sketch of the principall watercourses West of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Rocky Mountains\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains\">Rocky Mountains</a> a copy of which I preserved; <a href=\"#n34050803\" id=\"ln34050803\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> they make the main Southwardly branch of <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Lewis (Cahwahnakiooks) River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Lewis%20%28Cahwahnakiooks%29%20River\">Lewis's river</a> much more extensive than the other, and place many villages of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Shoshone Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Shoshone%20Indians\">Shoshonees</a> on it's western side. \u00a0\u00a0 at half after 3 P.
