here the wind compelled us to spend the ballance of the day. <a href=\"#n12050102\" id=\"ln12050102\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 we sent out some hunters who killed a buffaloe, an Elk, a goat and two beaver. \u00a0\u00a0 game is now abundant. \u00a0\u00a0 the country appears much more pleasant and fertile than that we have passed for several days; the hills are lower, the bottoms wider, and better stocked with timber, which consists principally of cottonwood, not however of large size; the under-growth willow on the verge of the river and sandbars, rose bushes, red willow and the broad leafed willow in the bottom lands; the high country on either side of the river is one vast plain, intirely destitute of timber, but is apparently fertile, consisting of a dark rich mellow looking lome. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Shields, John\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Shields%2C%20John\">John Shields</a> sick today with the rheumatism. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Shannon, George\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Shannon%2C%20George\">Shannon</a> killed a bird of the plover kind. <a href=\"#n12050103\" id=\"ln12050103\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 weight one pound. \u00a0\u00a0 it measured from the tip of the toe, to the extremity of the beak, 1 foot 10 inches; from tip to tip of wings when extended 2 F. 5 I.; Beak 3\u215d inches; tale 3\u215b inches; leg and toe 10 Ins.\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 the eye black, piercing, prominent and moderately large. \u00a0\u00a0 the legs are flat thin, slightly imbricated and of a pale sky blue colour, being covered with feathers as far as the mustle extends down it, which is about half it's length. \u00a0\u00a0 it has four toes on each foot, three of which, are connected by a web, the fourth is small and placed at the heel about the \u215b of an inch up the leg. \u00a0\u00a0 the nails are black and short, that of the middle toe is extreemly singular, consisting of two nails the one laping on or overlaying the other, the upper one somewhat the longest and sharpest. \u00a0\u00a0 the tale contains eleven feathers of equal length, &amp; of a bluish white colour. \u00a0\u00a0 the boddy and underside of the wings, except the large feathers of the 1st &amp; 2cd joints of the same, are white; as are also the feathers of the upper part of the 4th joint of the wing and part of those of the 3rd adjacent thereto, the large feathers of the 1st or pinion and the 2cd joint are black; a part of the larger feathers of the 3rd joint on the upper side and all the small feathers which cover the upper part of the wings are black, as are also the tuft of long feathers on each side of the body above the joining of the wing, leaving however a stripe of white betwen them on the back. \u00a0\u00a0 the head and neck are shaped much like the grey plover, and are of a light brickdust \u2329colour\u232a brown; the beak is black and flat, largest where it joins the head, and from thence becoming thiner and tapering to a very sharp point, the upper chap being \u215b of an inch the longest \u2329and\u232a turns down at the point and forms a little hook. \u00a0\u00a0 the nostrils, which commence near the head are long, narrow, connected, and parallel with the beak; the beak is much curved, the curvature being upwards in stead of downwards as is common with most birds; the substance of the beak precisely resembles whalebone at a little distance, and is quite as flexable as that substance their note resembles that of the grey plover, tho' is reather louder and more varied, their habits appear also to be the same, with this difference; that it sometimes rests on the water and swims which I do not recollect having seen the plover do. \u00a0\u00a0 this bird which I shall henceforth stile the <em class=\"hi\">Missouri plover,</em> generally feeds about the shallow bars of the river; to collect it's food which consists of [<em class=\"hi\">blank</em>], it immerces it's beak in the water and throws it's head and beak from side to side at every step it takes.</p>\n               <div class=\"p\">\n                  <div class=\"tei_table_head\">\n                        <em class=\"hi\">Courses and distances of this day</em>\n                         <a href=\"#n12050104\" id=\"ln12050104\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[4]</sup></a>\n                     </div><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class=\" tei_table\">\n                     \n                     <tr class=\" tei_tr\">\n                        <td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\" class=\" tei_td rowspan_1 colspan_1\"><span class=\"cell_contents\">N. 88 W.</span></td>\n                        <td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\" class=\" tei_td rowspan_1 colspan_1\"><span class=\"cell_contents\">to the upper point of some high timber in a bend on the<br/>\nStard side</span></td>\n                        <td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\" class=\" tei_td rowspan_1 colspan_1\"><span class=\"cell_contents\">\n                           <br/>\u00a0\u00a01 \u00bd</span></td>\n                     </tr>\n                     <tr class=\" tei_tr\">\n                        <td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\" class=\" tei_td rowspan_1 colspan_1\"><span class=\"cell_contents\">South</span></td>\n                        <td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\" class=\" tei_td rowspan_1 colspan_1\"><span class=\"cell_contents\">to the upper point of a timbered bottom Lard.

\u00a0\u00a0 it has three toes on a foot connected by a web. \u00a0\u00a0 there is also a small toe on each foot placed about the eighth of an inch up the leg behind. \u00a0\u00a0 the nails are black and short and those of the middle toes ar singular\u2014there being two nails on each the one above the other the upper one the longest and sharpest.\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 the tale contains eleven feathers of the same length of a bluish white colour. \u00a0\u00a0 the body and under side of the wings except the large feathers of the 1 &amp; 2cd joints of the wings are white, as are also the feathers of the upper part of the 4th joint of the wing. and some of those of the 3rd adjoining.\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 the large feathers of the pinion or first \u2329joint\u232a &amp; the second joint \u2329and a part of those of the third on the\u232a are black; a part of the larger feathers of the third-joint on the upper side and all the smaller feathers which cover the upper part of these joints ar black; as are also the tuft of long feathers on each side of the body above the joining of the wing, leaving however a stripe of white between them on the back. \u00a0\u00a0 the head and neck are shaped much like the grey plover, and is a light \u2329yellowish\u232a brickdust brown. \u00a0\u00a0 the beak is black and flat, largest where it joins the head and from thence tapering every way gradually to a very sharp point the upper beak being \u215b of an inch the longest turning down at the point. \u00a0\u00a0 the nostrils are parrallal with the beak and are long narrow and connected. \u00a0\u00a0 the beak is curvated and invirted; the Curvature being upwards in stead of downwards as those of most birds are\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 the substance of the beak is as flexable as whalebone and \u2329to all appe\u232a at a little distance precisely resembles that substance. \u00a0\u00a0 their note is like that of the common whistling or grey plover tho' reather louder, and more varied, and their habits are the same with that bird so far as I have been enabled to learn, with this difference however that this bird sometimes lights in the water and swims.\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 it generally feads about the shallow bars of the river; to collect it's food, it immerces it's beak in the water, and thows it's head and beak from side to side at every step it takes.\n</p>\n
