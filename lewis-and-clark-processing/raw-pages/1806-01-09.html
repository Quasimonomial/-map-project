I expect that the hunters <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Drouillard, George\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George\">Drewyer</a> and <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Collins, John\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Collins%2C%20John\">Collins</a> have fallen in with a gang of Elk. \u00a0\u00a0 some marrow bones and a little fresh meat would be exceptable; I have been living for two days past on poor dryed Elk, or <em class=\"hi\">jurk</em> as the hunters term it.</p>\n               <p>\nThe <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clatsop Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Clatsop%20Indians\">Clatsops</a>\n                  <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Chinook Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Chinook%20Indians\">Chinnooks</a> &amp;c. bury their dead in their canoes. \u00a0\u00a0 for this purpose four pieces of split timber are set erect on end, and sunk a few feet in the grown, each brace having their flat sides opposite to each other and sufficiently far assunder to admit the width of the canoes in which the dead are to be deposited; through each of these perpendicular posts, at the hight of six feet a mortice is cut, through which two bars of wood are incerted; on these cross bars a small canoe is placed in which the body is laid after being carefully roled in a robe of some dressed skins; a paddle is also deposited with them; a larger canoe is now reversed, overlaying and imbracing the small one, and resting with it's gunwals on the cross bars; one or more large mats of rushes or flags are then roled around the canoes and the whole securely lashed with a long cord, usually made of the bark of the <em class=\"hi\">Arbor vita</em> or white cedar. \u00a0\u00a0 on the cross bars which support the canoes is frequently hung or laid various articles of cloathing culinary eutensels &amp;c. \u00a0\u00a0 I cannot understand them sufficiently to make any enquiries relitive to their religious opinions, but presume from their depositing various articles with their dead, that they believe in a state of future existence.</p>\n               <p>\nThe persons who usually visit the entrance of this river for the purpose or traffic or hunting I believe are either English or Americans; the Indians inform us that they speak the same language with ourselves, and give us proofs of their varacity by repeating many words of English, as musquit, powder, shot, nife, file, damned rascal, sun of a bitch &amp;c. \u00a0\u00a0 whether these traders are from <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Nootka Sound\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Nootka%20Sound\">Nootka sound</a>, from some other late establishment on this coast, or immediately from the U' States or <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"England\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=England\">Great Britain</a>, I am at a loss to determine, nor can the Indians inform us. \u00a0\u00a0 the Indians whom I have asked in what direction the traders go when they depart from hence, or arrive here, always point to the S. W. from which it is presumeable that Nootka cannot be their destination; and as from Indian information a majority of these traders annually visit them about the beginning of April and remain with them six or seven Months, they cannot come immediately from <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"England\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=England\">Great Britain</a> or the U' States, the distance being too great for them to go and return in the ballance of the year. \u00a0\u00a0 from this circumstance I am sometimes induced to believe that there is some other establishment on the coast of America south West of this place of which little is but yet known to the world, or it may be perhaps on some Island in the pacific ocean between the Continents of Asia and America to the South West of us. <a href=\"#n27010901\" id=\"ln27010901\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> This traffic on the part of the whites consists in vending, guns, (principally old british or American musquits) powder, balls and Shot, Copper and brass kettles, brass teakettles and coffee pots, blankets from two to three point, <a href=\"#n27010902\" id=\"ln27010902\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> scarlet and blue Cloth (coarse), plates and strips of sheet copper and brass, large brass wire, knives, beads and tobacco with fishinghooks buttons and some other small articles;

It appears to me that nature has been much more deficient in her filial ties than in any others of the Strong effections of the humane heart, and therefore think our old men equally with our woman indebted to Sivilization for their ease and Comfort.
