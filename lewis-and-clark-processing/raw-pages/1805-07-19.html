I walked along shore today and killed an Antelope. \u00a0\u00a0 whever we get a view of the lofty summits of the mountains the snow presents itself, altho' we are almost suffocated in this confined vally with heat. \u00a0\u00a0 the pine cedar and balsum fir <a href=\"#n17071901\" id=\"ln17071901\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> grow on the mountains in irregular assemleages or spots mostly high up on their sides and summits. \u00a0\u00a0 this evening we entered much the most remarkable clifts that we have yet seen. \u00a0\u00a0 these clifts rise from the waters edge on either side perpendicularly to the hight of [<em class=\"hi\">NB: about</em>] 1200 feet. \u00a0\u00a0 every object here wears a dark and gloomy aspect. \u00a0\u00a0 the tow[er]ing and projecting rocks in many places seem ready to tumble on us. \u00a0\u00a0 the river appears to have forced it's way through this immence body of solid rock for the distance of 5\u00be miles and where it makes it's exit below has thrown on either side vast collumns of rocks mountains high. \u00a0\u00a0 the river appears to have woarn a passage just the width of it's channel or 150 yds. \u00a0\u00a0 it is deep from side to side nor is ther in the 1st 3 miles of this distance a spot except one of a few yards in extent on which a man could rest the soal of his foot. \u00a0\u00a0 several fine springs burst out at the waters edge from the interstices of the rocks. \u00a0\u00a0 it happens fortunately that altho' the current is strong it is not so much so but what it may be overcome with the oars for there is hear no possibility of using either the cord or Setting pole. \u00a0\u00a0 it was late in the evening before I entered this place and was obliged to continue my rout untill sometime after dark before I found a place sufficiently large to encamp my small party; at length such an one occurred on the lard. side where we found plenty of lightwood <a href=\"#n17071902\" id=\"ln17071902\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> and pichpine. this rock is a black grannite below and appears to be of a much lighter colour above and from the fragments I take it to be flint of a yelloish brown and light creemcolourd yellow.\u2014 <a href=\"#n17071903\" id=\"ln17071903\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 from the singular appeaerance of this place I called it the <em class=\"hi\">\n                     <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Gates of the Rocky Mountains\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Gates%20of%20the%20Rocky%20Mountains\">gates of the rocky mountains</a>.</em>\n                   <a href=\"#n17071904\" id=\"ln17071904\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 the mountains higher today than yesterday, saw some Bighorns and a few Antelopes also beaver and Otter; the latter are now very plenty one of the men killed one of them today with a setting pole. \u00a0\u00a0 musquetoes less troublesome than usual. \u00a0\u00a0 we had a thundershower today about 1 P. M. which continued about an hour and was attended with som hail. \u00a0\u00a0 we have seen no buffaloe since we enterd the mounts. \u00a0\u00a0 this morning early <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt. Clark</a> pursued his rout, saw early in the day the remains of several Indians camps formed of willow brush which appeared to have been inhabited some time this spring. \u00a0\u00a0 saw where the natives had pealed the bark off the pine trees about this same season. \u00a0\u00a0 this the indian woman with us informs that they do to obtain the sap and soft part of the wood [<em class=\"hi\">NB: wood</em>] and bark for food. \u00a0\u00a0 at 11 A. M. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt. C.</a> feell in with a gang of Elk of which he killed 2. \u00a0\u00a0 and not being able to obtain as much wood as would make a fire substituded the dung of the buffaloe and cooked a part of their meat on which they breakfasted and again pursueed their rout, which lay along an old indian road. \u00a0\u00a0 this evening they passed a hansome valley watered by a large creek <a href=\"#n17071905\" id=\"ln17071905\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[5]</sup></a> which extends itself with it's valley into the mountain to a considerable distance. \u00a0\u00a0 the latter part of the evening their rout lay over a hilly and mountanous country covered with the sharp fragments of flint which cut and bruised their feet excessively; nor wer the prickly pear of the leveler part of the rout much less painfull; they have now become so abundant in the open uplands that it is impossible to avoid them and their thorns are so keen and stif that they pearce a double thickness of dressed deers skin with ease. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt. C.</a> informed me that he extracted 17 of these bryers from his feet this evening after he encamped by the light of the fire. I have guarded or reather fortifyed my feet against them by soaling my mockersons with the hide of the buffaloe in parchment. \u00a0\u00a0 he encamped on the river <a href=\"#n17071906\" id=\"ln17071906\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[6]</sup></a> much fortiegud having passed two mountains in the course of the day and travelled about 30 miles.\u2014</p>\n               <div class=\"p\">\n
