The forepart of the last evening was fair but in the latter part of the night clouded up and contnued so with short intervals of sunshine untill a little before noon when the whole horizon was overcast, and I of course disappointed in making the observation which I much wished. I had sent <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Pryor, Nathaniel Hale\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Pryor%2C%20Nathaniel%20Hale\">Sergt. Pryor</a> and <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Windsor, Richard\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Windsor%2C%20Richard\">Windsor</a> early this morning with orders to procede up the river to some commanding eminence and take it's bearing as far as possible. \u00a0\u00a0 in the mean time the four others and myself were busily engaged in making two rafts on which we purposed descending the river; we had just completed this work when <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Pryor, Nathaniel Hale\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Pryor%2C%20Nathaniel%20Hale\">Sergt. Pryor</a> and <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Windsor, Richard\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Windsor%2C%20Richard\">Windsor</a> returned, it being about noon; they reported that they had proceded from hence S 70 W. 6 m. to the summit of a commanding eminence from whence the river on their left was about 2\u00bd miles distant; that a point of it's Lard. bluff, which was visible boar S 80 W. distant about 15 ms.; that the river on their left bent gradually arround to this point, and from thence seemed to run Northwardly. \u00a0\u00a0 we\nnow took dinner and embarcked with our plunder and five Elk's skins on the rafts but were soon convinced that this mode of navigation was hazerdous particularly with those rafts they being too small and slender. \u00a0\u00a0 we wet a part of our baggage and were near loosing one of our guns; I therefore determined to abandon the rafts and return as we had come, by land. I regreted much being obliged to leave my Elk's skins, which I wanted to assist in forming my leather boat; those we had prepared at <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Fort Mandan (N.

E. accompanyed by frequent showers of rain; we were wet and very could. \u00a0\u00a0 \u2329we\u232a  continued our rout down the river only a few miles before the abbruptness of the clifts and their near approach to the river compelled us take the plains and once more face the storm; here we boar reather too much to the North and it was late in the evening before we reached the river, in our way we killed two buffaloe and took with us as much of the flesh as served us that night, and a part of the next day. \u00a0\u00a0 we encamped a little below the entrance of the large dry Creek called <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Black Coulee (Lark Creek)\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Black%20Coulee%20%28Lark%20Creek%29\">Lark C.</a> having traveled abut 25 mes. since noon. \u00a0\u00a0 it continues to rain and we have no shelter, an uncomfortable nights rest is the natural consequence.\u2014</p>\n            </span>\n         </div>\n         <div class=\"entry lc.jrn.1805-06-06.02 tei_div\" id=\"lc.jrn.1805-06-06.02\">\n            <span class=\"tei_sp_who_wc tei_sp\">\n               <h4 class=\"entry_author\">[Clark]</h4>\n               <span class=\"tei_ab\">\n                  <div class=\"entry_date\">\n                     <em class=\"hi\">June 6th Thursday 1805</em>\n                  </div><div class=\"clear_return\">\u00a0</div>\n               </span>\n               <p>a Cloudy Cold raw day wind hard from the N.
