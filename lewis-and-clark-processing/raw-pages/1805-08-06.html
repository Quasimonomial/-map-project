Gass</a> to the right with orders to keep sufficiently near to discover <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt. C.</a> and the party should they be on their way up that stream and with <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Charbonneau, Toussaint\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Charbonneau%2C%20Toussaint\">Sharbono</a> I directed my course to the main forks through the bottom directing the others to meet us there. \u00a0\u00a0 about five miles above the forks I head the hooping of the party to my left and changed my rout towards them; on my arrival found that they had taken the rapid for and learnt from <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt. Clark</a> that he had not found the note which I had left for him at that place and the reasons which had induced him to ascend this stream. \u00a0\u00a0 it was easeist &amp; more in our direction, and apd. to contain as much water \u00a0\u00a0 he had hoever previously to my comeing up with him, met <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Drouillard, George\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George\">Drewyer</a> who informed him of the state of the two rivers and was on his return. \u00a0\u00a0 one of their canoes had just overset and all the baggage wet, the medecine box among other articles and several articles lost a shot pouch and horn with all the implements for one rifle lost and never recovered. I walked down to the point where I waited their return. \u00a0\u00a0 on their arrival found that two other canoes had filled with water and wet their cargoes completely. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Whitehouse, Joseph\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Whitehouse%2C%20Joseph\">Whitehouse</a> had been thrown out of one of the canoes as she swing in a rapid current and the canoe had rubed him and pressed him to the bottom as she passed over him and had the water been 2 inches shallower must inevitably have crushed him to death. \u00a0\u00a0 our parched meal, corn, Indian preasents, and a great part of our most valuable stores were wet and much damaged on this ocasion. \u00a0\u00a0 to examine, dry and arrange our stores was the first object; we therefore passed over to the lard. side opposite to the entrance of the rapid fork where there was a large gravly bar that answered our purposes; wood was also convenient and plenty. \u00a0\u00a0 here we fixed our camp, <a href=\"#n18080601\" id=\"ln18080601\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> and unloaded all our canoes and opened and exposed to dry such articles as had been wet. \u00a0\u00a0 a part of the load of each canoe consisted of the leaden canestirs of powder which were not in least injured, tho' some of them had remained upwards of an hour under water. \u00a0\u00a0 about 20 lbs. of powder which we had in a tight Keg or at l[e]ast one which we thought sufficiently so got wet and intirely spoiled. \u00a0\u00a0 this would have been the case with the other had it not have been for the expedient which I had fallen on of securing the powder by means of the lead having the latter formed into canesters which were filled with the necessary proportion of poder to discharge the lead when used, and those canesters well secured with corks and wax. \u00a0\u00a0 in this country the air is so pure and dry that any vessel however well seasoned the timber may be will give way or shrink unless it is kept full of some liquid. we found that three deer skins which we had left at a considerable hight on a tree were taken off which we supposed had been done by a panther. \u00a0\u00a0 we sent out some men to hunt this evening, they killed 3 deer and four Elk which gave us a plentifull supply om [of] meat once more. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Shannon, George\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Shannon%2C%20George\">Shannon</a> had been dispatched up the rapid fork this morning to hunt, by <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt Clark</a> before he met with <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Drouillard, George\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George\">Drewyer</a> or learnt his mistake in the rivers. When he returned he sent <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Drouillard, George\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George\">Drewyer</a> in surch of him, but he rejoined us this evening and reported that he had been several miles up the river and could find nothing of him. \u00a0\u00a0 we had the trumpet sounded and fired several guns but he did not join us this evening. I am fearful he is lost again.  this is the same man who was seperated from us 15 days as we came up the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Missouri River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Missouri%20River\">Missouri</a> and subsisted 9 days of that time on grapes only. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Whitehouse, Joseph\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Whitehouse%2C%20Joseph\">Whitehouse</a> is in much pain this evening with the injury one of his legs sustained from the canoe today at the time it upset and swing over him. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt Clarks</a> ankle is also very painfull to him.\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 we should have given the party a days rest some where near this place had not this accedent happened, as I had determined to take some observations to fix the Latitude and longitude of these forks. \u00a0\u00a0 our merchandize medecine &amp;c are not sufficiently dry this evening we covered them securely for the evening. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt Clark</a> had ascended the river about 9 miles from this place on a course of S 30\u00b0 W. before he met with <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Drouillard, George\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George\">Drewyer</a>.\u2014</p>\n               <p>\nwe beleive that the N. W. or rapid fork is the dane [<em class=\"hi\">NB: drain</em>] of the melting snows of the mountains, and that it is not as long as the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Madison River (Middle Fork)\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Madison%20River%20%28Middle%20Fork%29\">middle fork</a> and dose not at all seasons of the year supply anything like as much water as the other and that about this season it rises to it's greatest hight this last appears from the apparent bed of the river which is now over flown and the water in many plases spreads through old channels which have their bottoms covered with grass that has grown this season and in such as appears on the parts of the bottom not innundated. \u00a0\u00a0 we therefore determined that the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Madison River (Middle Fork)\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Madison%20River%20%28Middle%20Fork%29\">middle fork</a> was that which ought of right to bear the name we had given to the lower portion or <em class=\"hi\">\n                     <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Beaverhead (Jefferson) River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Beaverhead%20%28Jefferson%29%20River\">River Jefferson</a>\n                  </em> and called the bold rapid an clear stream <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Big Hole (Sensable, Wisdom) River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Big%20Hole%20%28Sensable%2C%20Wisdom%29%20River\">\n                     <em class=\"hi\">Wisdom,</em>\n                  </a> and the more mild an placid one which flows in from the S.
