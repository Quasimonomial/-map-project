we were happy to find no one hirt. The next morning we found that the buffaloe in passing the perogue had trodden on a rifle, which belonged to <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"York\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=York\">Capt. Clark's black man</a>, who had negligently left her in the perogue, the rifle was much bent, he had also broken the spindle, pivit, and shattered the stock of one of the bluntderbushes on board, with this damage I felt well content, happey indeed, that we had sustaned no further injury. \u00a0\u00a0 it appears that the white perogue, which contains our most valuable stores, is attended by some evil gennii. This morning we set out at an early hour and proceded as usual by the Chord. \u00a0\u00a0 at the distance of 2\u00bd miles passed a handsome river which discharged itself on the Lard. side, I walked on shore and acended this river about a mile and a half in order to examine it. I found this river about 100 yds. wide from bank to bank, the water occupying about 75 yard. \u00a0\u00a0 the bed was formed of gravel and mud with some sand; it appeared to contain much more water as [<em class=\"hi\">NB: than</em>] the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Musselshell (Mah-tush,-ah-zhah, Shell) River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Musselshell%20%28Mah-tush%2C-ah-zhah%2C%20Shell%29%20River\">Muscle-Shell river</a>, was more rappid but equally navigable; there were no large stone or rocks in it's bed to obstruct the navigation; the banks were low yet appeared seldom to\noverflow; the water of this River is \u2329Clear\u232a [<em class=\"hi\">NB: clearer much</em>] than any we have met with \u00a0\u00a0 great abundance of the Argalia or [<em class=\"hi\">NB: or</em>] Bighorned animals in the high country through which this river passes \u00a0\u00a0 Cap.
