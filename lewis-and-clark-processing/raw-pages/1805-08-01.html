Clark</a> and myself I set out with 3 men in quest of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Shoshone Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Shoshone%20Indians\">Snake</a> Indians. \u00a0\u00a0 the men I took were the two Interpreters <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Drouillard, George\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George\">Drewyer</a> and <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Charbonneau, Toussaint\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Charbonneau%2C%20Toussaint\">Sharbono</a> and <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Gass, Patrick\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick\">Sergt. Gass</a> who by an accedental fall had so disabled himself that it was with much pain he could work in the canoes tho' he could march with convenience. \u00a0\u00a0 the rout we took lay over a rough high range of mountains on the North side of the river. <a href=\"#n18080102\" id=\"ln18080102\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 the rive entered these mountains a few miles above where we left it. <a href=\"#n18080103\" id=\"ln18080103\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[3]</sup></a>\n                  <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt Clark</a> recommended this rout to me from a belief that the river as soon as it past the mountains boar to the N. of W. he having a few days before ascended these mountains to a position from which he discovered a large valley passing between the mountains and which boar to the N. West. \u00a0\u00a0 this however poved to be the inlet of a large creek which discharged itself into the river just above this range of mountains, <a href=\"#n18080104\" id=\"ln18080104\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> the river bearing to the S. W. we were therefore thrown several miles out of our rout. \u00a0\u00a0 as soon as we discovered our mistake we directed our course to the river which we at length gained about 2 P. M. much exhausted by the heat of the day the roughnes of the road and the want of water. \u00a0\u00a0 the mountains are extreemly bare of timber and our rout lay through the steep valleys exposed to the heat of the sun without shade and scarcely a breath of air; and to add to my fatiegue in this walk of about 11 miles I had taken a doze of glauber salts in the morning in consequence of a slight desentary with which I had been afflicted for several days; being weakened by the disorder and the opperation of the medecine I found myself almost exhausted before we reached the river. I felt my sperits much revived on our near approach to the river at the sight of a herd of Elk of which <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Drouillard, George\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George\">Drewyer</a> and myself killed two. \u00a0\u00a0 we then hurried to the river and allayed our thirst. I ordered two of the men to skin the Elk and bring the meat to the river while myself and the other prepared a fire and cooked some of the meat for our dinner. \u00a0\u00a0 we made a comfortable meal of the Elk and left the ballance of the meat on the bank of the river the party with <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt.

Clark</a> and party. \u00a0\u00a0 this supply will no doubt be acceptable to them, as they had had no fresh meat when I left them for almost 2 days except one beaver; game being very scarce and shy above <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Missouri River, Three Forks of the\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Missouri%20River%2C%20Three%20Forks%20of%20the\">the forks</a>. \u00a0\u00a0 we had seen a few deer and antelopes but had not been fortunate enough to kill any of them. \u00a0\u00a0 as I passed these mountains I saw a flock of the black or dark brown phesants; <a href=\"#n18080106\" id=\"ln18080106\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[6]</sup></a> the young phesant is almost grown we killed one of them. \u00a0\u00a0 this bird is fully a third larger than the common phesant of the Atlantic states. \u00a0\u00a0 it's form is much the same. \u00a0\u00a0 it is booted nearly to the toes and the male has not the tufts of long black feathers on the sides of the neck which are so conspicuous in those of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Atlantic Ocean\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Atlantic%20Ocean\">Atlantic</a>. \u00a0\u00a0 their colour is a uniform dark brown with a small mixture of yellow or yelloish brown specks on some of the feathers particularly those of the tail, tho' the extremities of these are perfectly black for about one inch. \u00a0\u00a0 the eye is nearly black, the iris has a small dash of yellowish brown. \u00a0\u00a0 the feathers of the tail are reather longer than that of our phesant or pattridge as they are Called in the Eastern States; are the same in number or eighteen and all nearly of the same length, those in the intermediate part being somewhat longest. \u00a0\u00a0 the flesh of this bird is white and agreeably flavored. \u00a0\u00a0 I also saw near the top of the mountain among some scattering pine a blue bird <a href=\"#n18080107\" id=\"ln18080107\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[7]</sup></a> about the size of the common robbin. \u00a0\u00a0 it's action and form is somewhat that of the jay bird and never rests long in any one position but constantly flying or hoping from sprey to sprey. I shot at one of them but missed it. \u00a0\u00a0 their note is loud and frequently repeated both flying and when at rest and is char \u00e2h', char'\u00e2h, char \u00e2h', as nearly as letters can express it. \u00a0\u00a0 after dinner we resumed our march and my pack felt much lighter than it had done about 2 hours before. \u00a0\u00a0 we traveled about six miles further and encamped on the stard. bank of the river, making a distance of 17 miles for this day. \u00a0\u00a0 the Musquetoes were troublesome but I had taken the precaution of bringing my bier.</p>\n               <p>\nShortly after I left <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt. Clark</a> this morning he proceed on and passed through the mountains; they formed tremendious clifts of ragged and nearly perpendicular rocks; the lower part of this rock is of the black grannite before mentioned and the upper part a light coloured free-stone. <a href=\"#n18080108\" id=\"ln18080108\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[8]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 these clifts continue for 9 miles and approach the river very closely on either side. \u00a0\u00a0 he found the current verry strong. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt. C.</a> killed a big horn on these clifts which himself and party dined on. \u00a0\u00a0 after passing this range of mountains he entered this beautifull valley in which we also were it is from 6 to 8 miles wide. \u00a0\u00a0 the river is crooked and crouded with islands, it's bottoms wide fertile and covered with fine grass from 9 inches to 2 feet high and possesses but a scant proportion of timber, which consists almost entirely of a few narrow leafed cottonwood trees <a href=\"#n18080109\" id=\"ln18080109\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[9]</sup></a> distributed along the verge of the river. \u00a0\u00a0 in the evening <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt.
