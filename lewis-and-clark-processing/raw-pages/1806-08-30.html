I told those Indians that they had been deef to our councils and ill treated us as we assended this river two years past, that they had abused all the whites who had visited them since. I believed them to be bad people &amp; Should not Suffer them to cross to the Side on which the party lay, and directed them to return with their band to their Camp, that if any of them come near our camp we Should kill them certainly. I lef them on the bear and returned to th party and examined the arms &amp;c. \u00a0\u00a0 those indians seeing Some Corn in the Canoe requested Some of it which I refused being deturmined to have nothing to do with those people.

I told this man to inform his nation that we had not forgot their treatment to us as we passed up this river &amp;c. \u00a0\u00a0 that they had treated all the white people who had visited them very badly; robed them of their goods, and had wounded one man <a href=\"#n39083004\" id=\"ln39083004\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> whome I had Seen. we viewed them as bad people and no more traders would be Suffered to come to them, and whenever the white people wished to visit the nations above they would Come Sufficiently Strong to whip any vilenous party who dare to oppose them and words to the Same purpote. I also told them that I was informed that a part of all their bands were gorn to war against the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Mandan Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Mandan%20Indians\">Mandans</a> &amp;c, and that they would be well whiped as the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Mandan Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Mandan%20Indians\">Mandans</a> &amp; <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Hidatsa Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Hidatsa%20Indians\">Menetarres</a> &amp; had a plenty of Guns Powder and ball, and we had given them a Cannon to defend themselves. \u00a0\u00a0 and derected them to return from the Sand bar and inform their Chiefs what we had Said to them, and to keep away from the river or we Should kill every one of them &amp;c. &amp;c. \u00a0\u00a0 those fellows requested to be allowed to Come aecross and make Cumerads which we positively refused and I directed them to return imediately which they did and after they had informed the Chiefs &amp;c. as I Suppose what we had Said to them, they all Set out on their return to their Camps back of a high hill. \u00a0\u00a0 7 of them halted on the top of the hill and blackguarded us, told us to come across and they would kill us all &amp;c. of which we took no notice. \u00a0\u00a0 we all this time were extreamly anxious for the arival of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Field, Joseph and Reubin\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Field%2C%20Joseph%20and%20Reubin\">2 fields</a> &amp; <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Shannon, George\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Shannon%2C%20George\">Shannon</a> whome we had left behind, and were Some what consd. as to their Safty. \u00a0\u00a0 to our great joy those men hove in Sight at 6 P.
