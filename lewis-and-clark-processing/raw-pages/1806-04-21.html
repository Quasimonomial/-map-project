M. with or without the horse being determined to remain no longer with these villains. \u00a0\u00a0 they stole another tomahawk from us this morning I surched many of them but could not find it. I ordered all the spare poles, paddles and the ballance of our canoe put on the fire as the morning was cold and also that not a particle should be left for the benefit of the indians. I detected a fellow in stealing an iron socket of a canoe pole and gave him several severe blows and mad the men kick him out of camp. I now informed the indians that I would shoot the first of them that attempted to steal an article from us. \u00a0\u00a0 that we were not affraid to fight them, that I had it in my power at that moment to kill them all and set fire to their houses, but it was not my wish to treat them with severity provided they would let my property alone. \u00a0\u00a0 that I would take their horses if I could find out the persons who had stolen the tommahawks, but that I had reather loose the property altogether than take the hose of an inosent person. \u00a0\u00a0 the chiefs were present hung their heads and said nothing. \u00a0\u00a0 at 9 A.

We found the horse, which had broke away last night, and made preparations for setting out from this place. While we were making preparations to start, an Indian stole some iron articles from among the men's hands; which so irritated <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Lewis, Meriwether\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether\">Captain Lewis</a>, that he struck him; which was the first act of the kind, that had happened during the expedition. <a href=\"#n32042109\" id=\"ln32042109\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[9]</sup></a> The Indians however did not resent it, otherwise it is probable we would have had a skirmish with them. This morning we disposed of two canoes and used another for firewood. At 10 o'clock we set out from the first narrows, with nine of our own and one we borrowed, <a href=\"#n32042110\" id=\"ln32042110\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[10]</sup></a> and two canoes all loaded heavy.

Here we got another horse; carried our canoes and baggage round the falls and halted for dinner. We also got some dogs here, and shapaleel, which we subsist on chiefly at present. We halted here two hours and then proceeded on again. The party that went by land had to leave the river, and take out to the hill a part of the way. I crossed with my canoe to the south side, where there is the best water, and passed a large rock island, <a href=\"#n32042111\" id=\"ln32042111\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[11]</sup></a> opposite to which the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Deschutes (Clark's, Towanahiook's) River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Deschutes%20%28Clark%27s%2C%20Towanahiook%27s%29%20River\">Sho-sho-ne river</a>\n                   <a href=\"#n32042112\" id=\"ln32042112\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[12]</sup></a> flows in from the south.
