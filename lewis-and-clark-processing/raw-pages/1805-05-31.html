The obstructions of rocky points and riffles still continue as yesterday; at those places the men are compelled to be \u2329much\u232a in the water even to their armpits, and the water is yet very could, and so frequent are those point that they are one fourth of their time in the water, added to this the banks and bluffs along which they are obliged to pass are so slippery and the mud so tenacious that they are unable to wear their mockersons, and in that situation draging the heavy burthen of a canoe and walking ocasionally for several hundred yards over the sharp fragments of rocks which tumble from the clifts and garish the borders of the river; in short their labour is incredibly painfull and great, yet those faithfull fellows bear it without a murmur. The toe rope of the white perogue, the only one indeed of hemp, and that on which we most depended, gave way today at a bad point, the perogue swung and but slightly touched a rock, yet was very near overseting; I fear her evil gennii will play so many pranks with her that she will go to the bottomm some of those days.\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt. C.</a> walked on shore this morning but found it so excessively bad that he shortly returned. \u00a0\u00a0 at 12 OCk. we came too for refreshment and gave the men a dram which they received with much cheerfullness, and well deserved.\u2014</p>\n               <p>\n                  The hills and river Clifts which we passed today exhibit a most romantic appearance. <a href=\"#n14053101\" id=\"ln14053101\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> The bluffs of the river rise to the hight of from 2 to 300 feet and in most places nearly perpendicular; they are formed of remarkable white sandstone which is sufficiently soft to give way readily to the impression of water; two or thre thin horizontal stratas of white free-stone, on which the rains or water make no impression, lie imbeded in these clifts of soft stone near the upper part of them; the earth on the top of these Clifts is a dark rich loam, which forming a graduly ascending plain extends back from \u00bd a mile to a mile where the hills commence and rise abruptly to a hight of about 300 feet more. The water in the course of time in decending from those hills and plains on either side of the river has trickled down the soft sand clifts and woarn it into a thousand grotesque figures, which with the help of a little immagination and an oblique view at a disance, are made to represent eligant ranges of lofty freestone buildings, having their parapets well stocked with statuary; collumns of various sculpture both grooved and plain, are also seen supporting long galleries in front of those buildings; in other places on a much nearer approach and with the help of less immagination we see the remains or ruins of eligant buildings; some collumns standing and almost entire with their pedestals and capitals; others retaining their pedestals but deprived by time or accident of their capitals, some lying prostrate an broken othes in the form of vast pyramids of connic structure bearing a sereis of other pyramids on their tops becoming less as they ascend and finally terminating in a sharp point. \u00a0\u00a0 nitches and alcoves of various forms and sizes are seen at different hights as we pass. \u00a0\u00a0 a number of the small martin <a href=\"#n14053102\" id=\"ln14053102\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> which build their nests with clay in a globular form attatched to the wall within those nitches, and which were seen hovering about the tops of the \u2329broken\u232a collumns did not the less remind us of some of those large stone buildings in the U' States. \u00a0\u00a0 the thin stratas of hard freestone intermixed with the soft sandstone seems to have aided the water in forming this curious scenery. As we passed on it seemed as if those seens of visionary inchantment would never have and end; for here it is too that nature presents to the view of the traveler vast ranges of walls of tolerable workmanship, <a href=\"#n14053103\" id=\"ln14053103\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> so perfect indeed are those walls that I should have thought that nature had attempted here to rival the human art of masonry had I not recollected that she had first began her work. These walls rise to the hight in many places of 100 feet, are perpendicular, with two regular faces and are from one to 12 feet thick, each wall retains the same thickess at top which it possesses at bottom. The stone of which these walls are formed is black, dence and dureable, and appears to be composed of a large portion of earth intermixed or cemented with a small quantity of sand and a considerable portion of talk or quarts. \u00a0\u00a0 these stones are almost invariably regular parallelepipeds, of unequal sizes in the walls, but equal in their horizontal ranges, at least as to debth. \u00a0\u00a0 these are laid regularly in ranges on each other like bricks, each breaking or covering the interstice of the two on which it rests. \u00a0\u00a0 thus the purpendicular interstices are broken, and the horizontal ones extend entire throughout the whole exent of the walls. These stones seem to bear some proportion to the thickess of the walls in which they are employed, being larger in the thicker walls; the greatest length of the parallelepiped appears to form the thickess of the thiner walls, while two or more are employed to form that of the thicker walls. These walls pass the river in several places, rising from the water's edge much above the sandstone bluffs, which they seem to penetrate; thence continuing their course on a streight line on either side of the river through the gradually ascending plains, over which they tower to the hight of from ten to seventy feet untill they reach the hills, which they finally enter and conceal themselves. \u00a0\u00a0 these walls sometimes run parallel to each other, with several ranges near each other, and at other times interscecting each other at right angles, having the appearance of the walls of ancient houses or gardens. I walked on shore this evening and examined these walls minutely and preserved a specimine of the stone. I found the face of many of the river hills formed of Clifts of very excellent free stone of a light yellowish brown colour; <a href=\"#n14053104\" id=\"ln14053104\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> on these clifts I met with a species of pine which I had never seen, it differs from the pitchpine in the particular of it's leaf and cone, the first being vastly shorter, and the latter considerably longer and more pointed. <a href=\"#n14053105\" id=\"ln14053105\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[5]</sup></a> I saw near those bluffs the most beautifull fox that I ever beheld, the colours appeared to me to be a fine orrange yellow, white and black, I endevoured to kill this anamal but it discovered me at a considerable distance, and finding that I could get no nearer, I fired on him as he ran, and missed him; he concealed himself under the rocks of the clift; it appeared to me to be about the size of the common red fox of the Atlantic states, or reather smaller than the large fox common to this country; convinced I am that it is a distinct species. <a href=\"#n14053106\" id=\"ln14053106\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[6]</sup></a>\n                  The appearance of coal continu[e]s but in small quanities, but litt[l]e appearance of birnt hills or pumice stones \u00a0\u00a0 the mineral salts have in some measure abated and no quarts. <a href=\"#n14053107\" id=\"ln14053107\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[7]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 we saw a great number of the Bighorn some mule deer and a few buffaloe and Elk, no antelopes or common deer. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Drouillard, George\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George\">Drewyer</a> who was with me and myself killed two bighorned anamals; the sides of the Clifts where these anamals resort much to lodg, have the peculiar smell of the sheepfolds. \u00a0\u00a0 the party killed in addition to our hunt 2 buffaloe and an Elk. \u00a0\u00a0 the river today has been from 150 to 250 yds. wide \u00a0\u00a0 but little timber today on the river.</p>\n               <div class=\"p\">\n                  <div

Soon after we got under way it began to rain and Continued untill 12 oClock when it Seased but Still remained cloudy through the ballance of the day. \u00a0\u00a0 the obstructions of rocky points and riffles Still continue as yesterday; at those places the men are compelled to be in the water even to their armpits, and the water is yet very cold, and So frequent are those points that they are one fourth of their time in the water. \u00a0\u00a0 added to this the bank and bluff along which they are obliged to pass are So Slippery and the mud So tenatious that they are unable to bare their mockersons, and in that Situation dragging the heavy burthen of a Canoe and Walking occasionally for Several hundred yards over the Sharp fragments of rocks which tumble from the Clifts; and in Short their labour is incredibly painfull and great, yet those faithfull fellows bear it without a murmer.</p>\n               <p>The toe rope of the white perogue, the only one indeed of hemp, and that on which we most depended, gave way to day at a bad point, the perogue Swong and but slightly touched a rock, yet was very near oversetting; I fear her evil Ginnie will play So many pranks with her that She will go to the bottom Some of those days.</p>\n               <p>I attempted to walk on Shore this morning but found it so excessivily bad that I Soon returned on board. \u00a0\u00a0 at 12 oClock we came too for refreshment and gave the men a dram which they received with much Chearfulness, and well deserved all wet and disagreeable. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Lewis, Meriwether\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether\">Capt. Lewis</a> walked on Shore, he informed one that he Saw \"the most butifull fox in the world\" the Colour appeared to him to be of a fine Orrange yellow, white and black, he fired at this fox running and missed him, he appeared to be about the size of the common red fox of the united States, or rather smaller.</p>\n               <p>The hills and river clifts which we pass to day exhibit a most romantic appearance. The Bluffs of the river rise to the hight of from 2 to 300 feet and in most places nearly perpendicular; they are formed of remarkable white Sandstone which is Sufficiently Soft to give way readily to the impression of water; two or three thin horizontal Stratas of white free Stone, on which the rains or water make no impression, lie imbeded in those clifts of Soft Stone near the upper part of them; the earth on the top of these clifts is a dark rich loam, which forming a gradual ascending plain extend back from \u00bd a mile to a mile where the hills commence and rise abruptly to the hight of about 300 feet more. The water in the Course of time acecending from those hills and plains on either Side of the river has trickled down the Soft Sand Clifts and woarn it into a thousand grotesque figures; which with the help of a little imagination and an oblique view at a distance are made to represent elegant ranges of lofty freestone buildings, haveing their parapets well Stocked with Statuary; Colloms of various Sculptures both Grooved and plain, are also Seen Supporting long galleries in part of those buildings; in other places on a much nearer approach and with the with the help of less immagination we See the remains of ruins of eligant buildings; Some Collumns Standing and almost entire with their pedestals and Capitals, others retaining their pedestals but deprived by time or accedint of their capitals, Some lying prostrate and broken, others in the form of vast Pyramids of connic Structure bearing a Serious of other pyramids on their tops becomeing less as they ascend and finally termonateing in a Sharp point. \u00a0\u00a0 nitches and alcoves of various forms and Sizes are Seen at different hights as we pass. \u00a0\u00a0 a number of the Small martin which build their nests with Clay of a globular form attached to the wall within those nitches, and which were Seen hovering about the top of the collumns did not the less remind us of Some of those large Stone buildings in the United States. The thin Stratas of hard free Stone intermixed with the Soft Sand Stone Seems to have aided the water in forming this Curious Scenery.</p>\n               <p>\nas we passed on it Seemed as if those Seens of Visionary enchantment would never have an end; for here it is too that nature presents to the view of the traveler vast ranges of walls of tolerable workmanship, So perfect indeed are those falls [walls] that I Should have thought that nature had attempted here to rival the human art of Masonry had I not recollected that She had first began her work. These walls rise to the hight in many places of 100 feet, are perpindicular, with two regular faces, and are from one to 12 feet thick, each wall retains the Same thickess to the top which it possesses at bottom. The Stone of which these walls are formed is black, dense and dureable, and appears to be Composed of a large portion of earth intermixed or Cemented with a Small quantity of Sand and a Considerable portion of quarts. \u00a0\u00a0 these Stones are almost invariably regular parallelepipeds, of unequal Sizes in the wall, but equal in their horizontal ranges, at least as to debth. \u00a0\u00a0 These are laid\nregularly in ranges on each other like bricks, each breaking or covering this interstice of the two on which it rests, thus the pirpendicular interstices are broken, and the horizontal ones extend entire throughout the\nwhole extent of the walls. These Stones Seam to bear Some proportion to the thickness of the walls in which they are employd, being larger in the thicker walls; the greatest length of the parallelepiped appear to form the\nthickness of the thiner walls, while two or more are employed to form that of the thicker walls. Those walls pass the river in Several places rising from the waters edge much above the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Sandstone Bluffs\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Sandstone%20Bluffs\">Sand Stone Bluffs</a>, which they Seam to penetrate; thence Continueing their course on a Streight line on either Side of the river thorough the gradually ascending plains over which they tower to the hight of from ten to 90 feet untill they reach the hills which they finally enter and Conceal themselves. \u00a0\u00a0 these walls Sometimes run parallel to each other, with Several ranges near each other, and at other times intersecting each other at right angles, haveing the appearance of the walls of ancient houses or gardins. \u00a0\u00a0 both <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Lewis, Meriwether\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether\">Capt Lewis</a> and My self walked on Shore this evening and examined those walls minutely and preserved a Specimine of the Stone.\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 I found many clifts of very excellent free Stone of a light yellowish brown Colour. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Lewis, Meriwether\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether\">Capt. Lewis</a> observed a Species of pine which I had never Seen, it differs from the pitch pine in the particular of its leaf and Cone, the first being partly Shorter, and the latter considerably longer and more pointed. The appearance of Coal Continues but in Smaller quantities, but little appearance of burnt hills or pumicestone. \u00a0\u00a0 the mineral Salt in Some measure have abated and no\nquarts. \u00a0\u00a0 we Saw a great number of the Big Horn, Some mule deer, and a few Buffalow and Elk, no antelopes or Common Deer\u2014. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Lewis, Meriwether\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether\">Capt.

The names are given in notes that follow as <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Lewis, Meriwether\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether\">Lewis</a> and <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Clark</a> make reference to the formations. During the glacial period, ice forced the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Missouri River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Missouri%20River\">Missouri River</a> to cut a new channel from near <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Virgelle, Mont.\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Virgelle%2C%20Mont.\">Virgelle</a> to <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Fort Peck Dam\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Fort%20Peck%20Dam\">Fort Peck Dam</a>, <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Montana\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Montana\">Montana</a>. The channel here has been cut more than three hundred feet deep through late Cretaceous formations of the Claggett Shale, <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Eagle Sandstone\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Eagle%20Sandstone\">Eagle Sandstone</a>, and Marias River Shale. The most conspicuous of these is the nearly white sandstone of the Virgelle Member of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Eagle Sandstone\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Eagle%20Sandstone\">Eagle Sandstone</a>. Red-brown iron concretions up to eight feet in diameter occur at the top of the Virgelle Member in many places. The concretions are very resistant to erosion and protect the softer, underlying sandstone. Sandstone not protected by concretions erodes away leaving columns and pillars of white sandstone. Various degrees of protection by overlying materials has produced a variety of geometric figures. (<a href=\"#ln14053101\">back</a>)</div>\n            <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"n14053102\">2.
