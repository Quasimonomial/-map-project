junction of the two large rivers. <a href=\"#n14060301\" id=\"ln14060301\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 here in the course of the day I continued my observations as are above stated. An interesting question was now to be determined; which of these rivers was the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Missouri River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Missouri%20River\">Missouri</a>, or that river which the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Hidatsa Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Hidatsa%20Indians\">Minnetares</a> call <em class=\"hi\">Amahte Arz zha</em>\n                   <a href=\"#n14060302\" id=\"ln14060302\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> or <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Missouri River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Missouri%20River\">Missouri</a>, and which they had discribed to us as approaching very near to the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Columbia River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Columbia%20River\">Columbia river</a>. \u00a0\u00a0 to mistake the stream at this period of the season, two months of the traveling season having now elapsed, and to ascend such stream to the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Rocky Mountains\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains\">rocky Mountain</a> or perhaps much further before we could inform ourselves whether it did approach the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Columbia River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Columbia%20River\">Columbia</a> or not, and then be obliged to return and take the other stream would not only loose us the whole of this season but would probably so dishearten the party that it might defeat the expedition altogether. \u00a0\u00a0 convinced we were that the utmost circumspection and caution was necessary in deciding on the stream to be taken. \u00a0\u00a0 to this end an investigation of both streams was the first thing to be done; to learn their widths, debths, comparitive rappidity of their courants and thence the comparitive bodies of water furnished by each; accordingly we dispatched two light canoes with three men in each up those streams; <a href=\"#n14060303\" id=\"ln14060303\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> we also sent out several small parties by land with instructions to penetrate the country as far as they conveniently can permiting themselves time to return this evening and indeavour if possible to discover the distant bearing of those rivers by ascending the rising grounds. \u00a0\u00a0 between the time of my A. M. and meridian <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt. C</a> &amp; myself stroled out to the top of the hights in the fork of these rivers from whence we had an extensive and most inchanting view; the country in every derection around us was one vast plain in which innumerable herds of Buffalow were seen attended by their shepperds the wolves; the solatary antelope which now had their young were distributed over it's face; some herds of Elk were also seen; the verdure perfectly cloathed the ground, the weather was pleasent and fair; to the South we saw a range of lofty mountains which we supposed to be a continuation of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Highwood (South) Mountains\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Highwood%20%28South%29%20Mountains\">S. Mountains</a>, streching themselves from S. E. to N. W. terminating abbrubtly about S. West from us; these were partially covered with snow; behind these Mountains and at a great distance, a second and more lofty range of mountains appeared to strech across the country in the same direction with the others, reaching from West, to the N of N. W., where their snowey tops lost themselves beneath the horizon. \u00a0\u00a0 this last range was perfectly covered with snow. <a href=\"#n14060304\" id=\"ln14060304\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> the direction of the rivers could be seen but little way, soon loosing the break of their channels, to our view, in the common plain. \u00a0\u00a0 on our return to camp we boar a little to the left and discovered a handsome little river <a href=\"#n14060305\" id=\"ln14060305\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[5]</sup></a> falling into the N. fork on Lard. side about 1\u00bd ms. above our camp. \u00a0\u00a0 this little river has as much timber in it's bottoms as either of the larger streams. there are a great number of prickley pears in these plains; the Choke cherry grows here in abundance both in the river bottoms and in the steep ravenes along the river bluffs. \u00a0\u00a0 saw the yellow and red courants, not yet ripe; also the goosberry which begins to ripen; the wild rose which grows here in great abundance in the bottoms of all these rivers is now in full bloom, and adds not a little to the beaty of the cenery. <a href=\"#n14060306\" id=\"ln14060306\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[6]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 we took the width of the two rivers, found the left hand or S. fork 372 yards and the N. fork 200. The noth fork is deeper than the other but it's courant not so swift; it's waters run in the same boiling and roling manner which has uniformly characterized the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Missouri River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Missouri%20River\">Missouri</a> throughout it's whole course so far; it's waters are of a whitish brown colour very thick and terbid, also characteristic of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Missouri River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Missouri%20River\">Missouri</a>; while the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Gallatin (South, Southeast Fork) River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Gallatin%20%28South%2C%20Southeast%20Fork%29%20River\">South fork</a> is perfectly transparent runds very rappid but with a smoth unriffled surface it's bottom composed of round and flat smooth stones like most rivers issuing from a mountainous country. \u00a0\u00a0 the bed of the N. fork composed of some gravel but principally mud; in short the air &amp; character of this river is so precisely that of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Missouri River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Missouri%20River\">missouri</a> below that the party with very few exceptions have already pronounced the N. fork to be the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Missouri River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Missouri%20River\">Missouri</a>; myself and <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt. C.</a> not quite so precipitate have not yet decided but if we were to give our opinions I believe we should be in the minority, certain it is that <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Jefferson River (North, Southwest Fork)\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Jefferson%20River%20%28North%2C%20Southwest%20Fork%29\">the North fork</a> gives the colouring matter and character which is retained from hence to the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Gulf of Mexico\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Gulf%20of%20Mexico\">gulph of Mexico</a>.
