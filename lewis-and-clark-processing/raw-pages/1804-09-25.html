The \"soldiers,\" as the French traders called them, were warriors chosen to enforce order and discipline on certain occasions, such as hunts, when irresponsible individual behavior could not be tolerated. Sometimes the duty was assigned to the members of a particular warrior society. They punished offenders by flogging with horsewhips, killing the guilty party's dogs or horses, or by destroying his inanimate property. Since their appointment was temporary, the fear of retaliation sometimes inhibited them in the performance of their duties. Chiefs often appointed a soldier to protect a trader during his sojourn with the tribe. See below, <a href=\"lc.jrn.1804-09-26\">September 26, 1804</a>.
