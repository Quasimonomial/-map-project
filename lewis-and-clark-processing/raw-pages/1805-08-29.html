While I lay here to day, one of the natives shewed me their method of producing fire, which is somewhat curious. They have two sticks ready for the operation, one \nabout 9 and the other 18 inches long: the short stick they lay down flat and rub the end of the other upon it in a perpendicular direction for a few minutes; and the friction raises a kind of dust, which in a short time takes fire. These people make willow basket so close and to such perfection as to hold water, for which purpose they make use of them. They make much use of the sunflower and lambs-quarter seed, as before mentioned; which with berries and wild cherries pounded together, compose the only bread they have any knowledge of, or in use. The fish they take in this river are of excellent kinds, especially the salmon, the roes of which when dried and pounded make the best of soup.\n\n</p>\n            </span>\n         </div>\n         <div class=\"entry lc.jrn.1805-08-29.04 tei_div\" id=\"lc.jrn.1805-08-29.04\">\n            <span class=\"tei_sp_who_jw tei_sp\">\n               <h4 class=\"entry_author\">[Whitehouse]</h4>\n               <span class=\"tei_ab\">\n                  <div class=\"clear_return\">\u00a0</div>\n               </span>\n               <p>\n                  <em class=\"hi\">Thursday 29th August 1805</em>. \u00a0\u00a0 a clear pleasant morning. \u00a0\u00a0 about 8 oClock A. m. a nomber of Indians arived here from the East Side of the Mountain. \u00a0\u00a0 they belonged to this nation but had been gone a long time and one of the warries had been Sculped by Some war party in the plain. \u00a0\u00a0 a nomber of their relation cryed aloud when they arived in the village. \u00a0\u00a0 <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Lewis, Meriwether\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether\">Capt.
