we took breakfast and departed at 9 A. M. \u00a0\u00a0 we continued up the N. side of the river nearly to the place at which we had encamped on the 3rd of Nov. <a href=\"#n31040601\" id=\"ln31040601\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> when we passed the river to the south side in quest of the hunters we had sent up yesterday and the day before. \u00a0\u00a0 from the appearance of a rock near which we had encamped on the 3rd of November last I could judge better of the rise of the water than I could at any point below. I think the flood of this spring has been about 12 feet higher than it was at that time; the river is here about 1\u00bd miles wide; it's general width from the beacon \u00a0\u00a0 [<em class=\"hi\">NB: beaten before\u2014but really beacon</em>] rock <a href=\"#n31040602\" id=\"ln31040602\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> which may be esteemed the head of tide water, to the marshey islands is from one to 2 miles tho' in many places it is still wider. \u00a0\u00a0 it is only in the fall of the year when the river is low that the tides are persceptable as high as the beacon rock. \u00a0\u00a0 this remarkable rock which stands on the North shore of the river is unconnected with the hills and rises to the hight of seven hundred feet; it has some pine or reather fir timber on it's nothern side, the southern is a precipice of it's whole hight. \u00a0\u00a0 it rises to a very sharp point and is visible for 20 miles below on the river. \u00a0\u00a0 at the distance of ten miles from our encampment we met with our hunters in the upper end of the bottom to which we had directed them on the South side of the river. \u00a0\u00a0 they had killed three Elk this morning and wounded two others so badly that they expected to get them. \u00a0\u00a0 we therefore determined to encamp for the evening at this place in order to dry the meat, in surch of which we sent a party immediately and employed others in preparing scaffoalds and collecting firewood &amp;c against their return. \u00a0\u00a0 we found some indians with our hunters when we arrived; these people are constantly hanging about us.\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 As has been before mentioned <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt C</a> set out with a party of seven men on 2ed inst. in surch of the entrance of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Willamette (Multnomah) River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Willamette%20%28Multnomah%29%20River\">Multnomah river</a>. \u00a0\u00a0 he departed at \u00bd after 11 A. M and directed his course along the Southern side of the river. \u00a0\u00a0 at the distance of 8 miles he passed the village of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Ne-cha-co-lee village\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Ne-cha-co-lee%20village\">Na-cha-co-lee</a> tribe of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Wishram-Wasco Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Wishram-Wasco%20Indians\">E-lute Nation</a>; this village is not large and being situated on the main shore opposite to and S. of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Government (Diamond, White Goose, Swan) Island\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Government%20%28Diamond%2C%20White%20Goose%2C%20Swan%29%20Island\">Diamond Island</a> it was concealed by that island from our view both ascending and decending the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Columbia River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Columbia%20River\">Columbia</a> as we passed near the Northern shore. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt C.</a> passed this village without halting and continued his rout untill 3 P. M. when he arrived at a large double house of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Ne-cha-co-lee village\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Ne-cha-co-lee%20village\">Ne-er-cho-ki-oo</a> tribe of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Watlala Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Watlala%20Indians\">Sh\u00e2h'-ha-la</a> nation; at this place we had seen 24 additional straw and bark huts as we passed down last fall, the inhabitants of which as I have before mentioned reside at the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Columbia River, Cascades (Great Rapids, Great Shute)\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Columbia%20River%2C%20Cascades%20%28Great%20Rapids%2C%20Great%20Shute%29\">great rapids of the Columbia river</a>. \u00a0\u00a0 about this place in different directions <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt C.</a> saw a great number of small canoes lying scattered on the bank. \u00a0\u00a0 these small canoes are employed by the women in collecting wappetoe; with one of these a woman enters a pond where the Sagitaria Sagittifolia grows frequently to her breast in water and by means of her toes and feet breakes the bulb of this plant loos from the parent radicle and disincumbering it from the mud it immediately rises to the surface of the water when she seizes it and throws it into her canoe which she always keeps convenient to her. \u00a0\u00a0 they will remain in the water for hours together in surch of this bulb in middle of winter. \u00a0\u00a0 those canoes are from 10 to 14 feet in length, from 18 to 23 inches in width near the middle tapering or becoming narrower towards either extremity and 9 inches deep \u00a0\u00a0 their form is thus. <a href=\"#n31040603\" id=\"ln31040603\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 they are so light that a woman can draw them over land or take them with ease through the swamps in any direction, and are sufficient to carry a single person and several bushells of roots. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt. Clarks</a> pilot informed him that the small canoes which he saw in the vicinity of this lodge were the property of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Watlala Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Watlala%20Indians\">Shah-ha-las</a> who used them occasionally when they visit this neighbourhood for the purpose of collecting roots. \u00a0\u00a0 while at this place <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt C.</a> entered one of the appartments of the house and offered several articles to the natives in exchange for wappetoe, they appeared to be in an ill humour and positively refused to let him have any. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt. C.</a> sat himself down near the fire and having a part of a portfire match <a href=\"#n31040604\" id=\"ln31040604\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> in his pocket cut of a small peice of it and threw it in the fire; at the same time he took out his pocket compass and by means of a magnet which he had in the top of his inkstand he turned the nedle of the compass about very briskly; the match took fire and birned vehemently; the indians astonished and allarmed at these exhibitions, ran and brought several parcels of wappetoe and laid at his feet and begged that he would put out the bad fire; to this he consented; at this moment the match being exhausted was of course extenguished and he put up his compass &amp; magnet. \u00a0\u00a0 they were now much more complisant, tho' the women and children were yet so much allarmed that they took refuge in their beads and behing the men who were seting opposite to <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt.

C.</a> gave them on adiquate compensation for their roots and having lighted his pipe smoaked with the men. \u00a0\u00a0 they appeared in a great measure to get the better of their allarm and he left them and continued his rout along the south side of <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Hayden (Image Canoe) Island\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Hayden%20%28Image%20Canoe%29%20Island\">Image canoe Island</a> which he found to be three islands, the one in the center concealing the apperture between the two others in such manners that from the north side of the river where we have previously passed they all appeared to form one island only. \u00a0\u00a0 at the distance of 13 miles below the village just mentioned, and at the lower point of what we have heretofore deemed the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Hayden (Image Canoe) Island\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Hayden%20%28Image%20Canoe%29%20Island\">image canoe Island</a>, <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt C.</a> entered the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Willamette (Multnomah) River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Willamette%20%28Multnomah%29%20River\">Multn\u00f3m\u00e2h river</a> so called by the natives from a nation of that name who reside on <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Sauvie (Wapato) Island\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Sauvie%20%28Wapato%29%20Island\">wappetoe island</a> a little below the entrance of this river. <a href=\"#n31040605\" id=\"ln31040605\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[5]</sup></a>\n                  <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Willamette (Multnomah) River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Willamette%20%28Multnomah%29%20River\">Multnomah river</a> discharges itself on the S. side of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Columbia River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Columbia%20River\">Columbia</a> 140 miles above the entrance of the latter into the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Pacific Ocean\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Pacific%20Ocean\">Pacific Ocean</a>, and may be justly esteemed one fourth of that noble river. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt.
