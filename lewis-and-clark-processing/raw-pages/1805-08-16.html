I informed the Ceif of my view in this measure, and requested that he would keep his young men wih us lest by their hooping and noise they should allarm the game and we should get nothing to eat, but so strongly were there suspicions exited by this measure that two parties of discovery immediately set out one on ech side of the valley to watch the hunters as I beleive to see whether they had not been sent to give information of their approach to an enemy that they still preswaided themselves were lying in wait for them. I saw that any further effort to prevent their going would only add strength to their suspicions and therefore said no more. \u00a0\u00a0 after the hunters had been gone about an hour we set out. \u00a0\u00a0 we had just passed through the narrows when we saw one of the spies comeing up the level plain under whip, the chief pawsed a little and seemed somewhat concerned. I felt a good deel so myself and began to suspect that by some unfortunate accedent that perhaps some of there enimies had straggled hither at this unlucky moment; but we were all agreeably disappointed on the arrival of the young man to learn that he had come to inform us that one of the whitemen had killed a deer. \u00a0\u00a0 in an instant they all gave their horses the whip and I was taken nearly a mile before I could learn what were the tidings; as I was without tirrups and an Indian behind me the jostling was disagreeable \u00a0\u00a0 I therefore reigned up my horse and forbid the indian to whip him who had given him the lash at every jum for a mile fearing he should loose a part of the feast. \u00a0\u00a0 the fellow was so uneasy that he left me the horse dismounted and ran on foot at full speed, I am confident a mile. \u00a0\u00a0 when they arrived where the deer was which was in view of me they dismounted and ran in tumbling over each other like a parcel of famished dogs each seizing and tearing away a part of the intestens which had been previously thrown out by <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Drouillard, George\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George\">Drewyer</a> who killed it; the seen was such when I arrived that had I not have had a pretty keen appetite myself I am confident I should not have taisted any part of the venison shortly. \u00a0\u00a0 each one had a peice of some discription and all eating most ravenously. \u00a0\u00a0 some were eating the kidnies the melt <a href=\"#n19081601\" id=\"ln19081601\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> and liver and the blood runing from the corners of their mouths, others were in a similar situation with the paunch and guts but the exuding substance in this case from their lips was of a different discription. \u00a0\u00a0 one of the last who attacted my attention particularly had been fortunate in his allotment or reather active in the division, he had provided himself with about nine feet of the small guts one end of which he was chewing on while with his hands he was squezzing the contents out at the other. I really did not untill now think that human nature ever presented itself in a shape so nearly allyed to the brute creation. I viewed these poor starved divils with pity and compassion \u00a0\u00a0 I directed <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"McNeal, Hugh\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=McNeal%2C%20Hugh\">McNeal</a> to skin the deer and reserved a quarter, the ballance I gave the Chief to be divided among his people; they devoured the whole of it nearly without cooking. I now boar obliquely to the left in order to interscept the creek where there was some brush to make a fire, and arrived at this stream where <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Drouillard, George\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George\">Drewyer</a> had killed a second deer; here nearly the same seene was encored. \u00a0\u00a0 a fire being kindled we cooked and eat and gave the ballance of the two deer to the Indians who eat the whole of them even to the soft parts of the hoofs. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Drouillard, George\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George\">Drewyer</a> joined us at breakfast with a third deer. \u00a0\u00a0 of this I reserved a quarter and gave the ballance to the Indians. \u00a0\u00a0 they all appeared now to have filled themselves and were in a good humour. \u00a0\u00a0 this morning early soon after the hunters set out a considerable part of our escort became allarmed and returned \u00a0\u00a0 28 men and three women only continued with us. \u00a0\u00a0 after eating and suffering the horses to graize about 2 hours we renued our march and towads evening arrived at the lower part of the cove \u00a0\u00a0 <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Shields, John\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Shields%2C%20John\">Shields</a> killed an Antelope on the way a part of which we took and gave the remainder to the Indians. \u00a0\u00a0 being now informed of the place at which I expected to meat <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt C.</a> and the party they insisted on making a halt, which was complyed with. \u00a0\u00a0 we now dismounted and the Chief with much cerimony put tippets about our necks such as they temselves woar I redily perceived that this was to disguise us and owed it's origine to the same cause already mentioned. \u00a0\u00a0 to give them further confidence I put my cocked hat with feather on the chief and my over shirt being of the Indian form my hair deshivled and skin well browned with the sun I wanted no further addition to make me a complete Indian in appearance \u00a0\u00a0 the men followed my example and we were son completely metamorphosed. I again repeated to them the possibility of the party not having arrived at the place which I expected they were, but assured them they could not be far below, lest by not finding them at the forks their suspicions might arrise to such hight as to induce them to return precipitately. \u00a0\u00a0 we now set out and rode briskly within sight of the forks making one of the Indians carry the flag that our own party should know who we were. \u00a0\u00a0 when we arrived in sight at the distance of about 2 miles I discovered to my mortification that the party had not arrived, and the Indians slackened their pace. I now scarcely new what to do and feared every moment when they would halt altogether, I now determined to restore their confidence cost what it might and therefore gave the Chief my gun and told him that if his enimies were in those bushes before him that he could defend himself with that gun, that for my own part I was not affraid to die and if I deceived him he might make what uce of the gun he thought proper or in other words that he might shoot me. \u00a0\u00a0 the men also gave their guns to other indians which seemed to inspire them with more confidence; they sent their spies before them at some distance and when I drew near the place <a href=\"#n19081602\" id=\"ln19081602\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> I thought of the notes which I had left and directed <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Drouillard, George\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George\">Drewyer</a> to go with an Indian man and bring them to me which he did. \u00a0\u00a0 the indian seeing him take the notes from the stake on which they had been plased I now had recource to a stratagem in which I thought myself justifyed by the occasion, but which I must confess set a little awkward. \u00a0\u00a0 it had it's desired effect.\u00a0\u00a0  after reading the notes which were the same I had left I told the Chief that when I had left my brother Chief with the party below where the river entered the mountain that we both agreed not to bring the canoes higher up than the next forks of the river above us wherever this might happen, that there he was to wait my return, should he arrive first, and that in the event of his not being able to travel as fast as usual from the difficulty of the water, that he was to send up to the first forks above him and leave a note informing me where he was, that this note was left here today and that he informed me where he was, that this note was left here today and that he informed me that he was just below the mountains and was coming on slowly up, and added that I should wait here for him, but if they did not beleive me that I should send a man at any rate to the Chief and they might also send one of their young men with him, that myself and two others would remain with them at this place. \u00a0\u00a0 this plan was readily adopted and one of the young men offered his services; I promised him a knife and some beads as a reward for his confidence in us. \u00a0\u00a0 most of them seemed satisfyed but there were several that complained of the Chief's exposing them to danger unnecessarily and said that we told different stories, in short a few were much dissatisfyed. I wrote a note to <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt. Clark</a> by the light of some willow brush and directed <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Drouillard, George\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George\">Drewyer</a> to set out early being confident that there was not a moment to spare. \u00a0\u00a0 the chief and five or six others slept about my fire and the others hid themselves in various parts of the willow brush to avoid the enimy whom they were fearfull would attack them in the course of the night. I now entertained various conjectures myself with rispect to the cause of <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt. Clarks</a> detention and was even fearfull that he had found the river so difficult that he had halted below the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Rattlesnake Cliffs\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Rattlesnake%20Cliffs\">Rattlesnake bluffs</a>. I knew that if these people left me that they would immediately disperse and secrete themselves in the mountains where it would be impossible to find them or at least in vain to pursue them and that they would spread the allarm to all other bands within our reach &amp; of course we should be disappointed in obtaining horses, which would vastly retard and increase the labour of our voyage and I feared might so discourage the men as to defeat the expedition altogether. \u00a0\u00a0 my mind was in reallity quite as gloomy all this evening as the most affrighted indian but I affected cheerfullness to keep the Indians so who were about me. \u00a0\u00a0 we finally laid down and the Chief placed himself by the side of my musquetoe bier. I slept but little as might be well expected, my mind dwelling on the state of the expedition which I have ever held in equal estimation with my own existence, and the fait of which appeared at this moment to depend in a great measure upon the caprice of a few savages who are ever as fickle as the wind. I had mentioned to the chief several times that we had with us a woman of his nation who had been taken prisoner by the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Hidatsa Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Hidatsa%20Indians\">Minnetares</a>, and that by means of her I hoped to explain myself more fully than I could do by signs. some of the party had also told the Indians that we had a man with us who was black and had short curling hair, this had excited their curiossity very much. \u00a0\u00a0 and they seemed quite as anxious to see this monster as they wer the merchandize which we had to barter for their horses.</p>\n               <p>\nat 7 A M. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt. C.</a> set out after breakfast. \u00a0\u00a0 he changed the hands in some of the canoes; they proceeded with more ease than yesterday, yet they found the river still rapid and shallow insomuch that they were obliged to drag the large canoes the greater part of the day. \u00a0\u00a0 considerable quantities of the buffaloe clover grows along the narrow bottoms through which they passed. \u00a0\u00a0 there was no timber except a few scatiring small pine on the hills. \u00a0\u00a0 willow service berry and currant bushes were the growth of the river bottoms. \u00a0\u00a0 they geathered considerable quantities of service berries, and caught some trout. \u00a0\u00a0 one deer was killed by the hunters who slept out last night. \u00a0\u00a0 and did not join the party until 10 A.
