there was ice on the vessels of water which stood exposed to the air nearly a quarter of an inch thick. \u00a0\u00a0 we collected our horses and set out at sunrise. \u00a0\u00a0 we soon arrived at the extreem source of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Missouri River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Missouri%20River\">Missouri</a>; here I halted a few minutes, the men drank of the water and consoled themselves with the idea of having at length arrived at this long wished for point. \u00a0\u00a0 from hence we proceeded to a fine spring on the side of the mountain where I had lain the evening before I first arrived at the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Shoshone Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Shoshone%20Indians\">Shoshone</a> Camp. \u00a0\u00a0 here I halted to dine and graize our horses, there being fine green grass on that part of the hillside which was moistened by the water of the spring while the grass on the other parts was perfectly dry and parched with the sun. I directed a pint of corn to be given each Indian who was engaged in transporting our baggage and about the same quantity to each of the men which they parched pounded and made into supe. \u00a0\u00a0 one of the women who had been assisting in the transportation of the baggage halted at a little run about a mile behind us, and set on the two pack horses which she had been conducting by one of her female friends. I enquired of <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Cameahwait\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Cameahwait\">Cameahwait</a> the cause of her detention, and was informed by him in an unconcerned manner that she had halted to bring fourth a child and would soon overtake us; in about an hour the woman arrived with her newborn babe and passed us on her way to the camp apparently as well as she ever was. It appears to me that the facility and ease with which the women of the aborigines of North America bring fourth their children is reather a gift of nature than depending as some have supposed on the habitude of carrying heavy burthens on their backs while in a state of pregnancy. \u00a0\u00a0 if a pure and dry air, an elivated and cold country is unfavourable to childbirth, we might expect every difficult incident to that operation of nature in this part of the continent; again as the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Shoshone Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Shoshone%20Indians\">snake</a> Indians possess an abundance of horses, their women are seldom compelled like those in other parts of the continent to carry burthens on their backs, yet they have their children with equal convenience, and it is a rare occurrence for any of them to experience difficulty in childbirth. I have been several times informed by those who were conversent with the fact, that the indian women who are pregnant by whitemen experience more difficulty in childbirth than when pregnant by an Indian. \u00a0\u00a0 if this be true it would go far in suport of the opinion I have advanced.\u2014</p>\n               <p>\nthe tops of the high and irregular mountains which present themselves to our view on the opposite side of this branch of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Columbia River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Columbia%20River\">Columbia</a> are yet perfectly covered with snow; the air which proceeds from those mountains has an agreeable coolness and renders these parched and South hillsides much more supportable at this time of the day it being now about noon. I observe the indian women collecting the root of a speceis of fennel <a href=\"#n21082601\" id=\"ln21082601\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> which grows in the moist grounds and feeding their poor starved children; it is really distressing to witness the situation of those poor wretches. \u00a0\u00a0 the radix of this plant is of the knob kind, of a long ovate form terminating in a single radicle, the whole bing about 3 or four inches in length and the thickest part about the size of a man's little finger. \u00a0\u00a0 it is white firm and crisp in it's present state, when dryed and pounded it makes a fine white meal; the flavor of this root is not unlike that of annisseed but not so pungent; the stem rises to the hight of 3 or four feet is jointed smooth and cilindric; from 1 to 4 of those knobed roots are attatched to the base of this stem. \u00a0\u00a0 the leaf is sheathing sessile, &amp; pultipartite [multipartite], the divisions long and narrow; the whole is of a deep green. \u00a0\u00a0 it is now in blume; the flowers are numerous, small, petals white, and are of the umbellaferous kind. \u00a0\u00a0 several small peduncles put forth from the main stock one at each joint above the sheathing leaf. \u00a0\u00a0 it has no root leaves. \u00a0\u00a0 the root of the present year declines when the seeds have been matured and the succeeding spring other roots of a similar kind put fourth from the little knot which unites the roots and stem and grow and decline with the stem as before mentioned. The sunflower <a href=\"#n21082602\" id=\"ln21082602\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> is very abundant near the watercourses the seeds of this plant are now rip and the natives collect them in considerable quantities and reduce them to meal by pounding and rubing them between smooth stones. \u00a0\u00a0 this meal is a favorite food their manner of using it has been beforementioned. \u00a0\u00a0 after dinner we continued our rout towards the village. \u00a0\u00a0 on our near approach we were met by a number of young men on horseback. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Cameahwait\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Cameahwait\">Cameahwait</a> requested that we would discharge our guns when we arrived in sight of the Village, accordingly when I arrived on an eminence above the village in the plain I drew up the party at open order in a single rank and gave them a runing fire discharging two rounds. \u00a0\u00a0 they appeared much gratifyed with this exhibition. \u00a0\u00a0 we then proceeded to the village or encampment of brush lodges 32 in number. \u00a0\u00a0 we were conducted to a large lodge which had been prepared for me in the center of their encampment which was situated in a beautifull level smooth and extensive bottom near the river about 3 miles above the place I had first found them encamped. <a href=\"#n21082603\" id=\"ln21082603\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 here we arrived at 6 in the evening arranged our baggage near my tent and placed those of the men on either side of the baggage facing outwards. I found <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Colter, John\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Colter%2C%20John\">Colter</a> here who had just arrived with a letter from <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt. Clark</a> in which <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt. C.</a> had given me an account of his perigrination and the description of the river and country as before detailed [<em class=\"hi\">WC: advised the purchase of horses, and the pursute of a rout he had learned from his guid who had promised to pilot ous to a road to the North &amp;c</em>] \u00a0\u00a0 from this view of the subject I found it a folly to think of attemping to decend this river in canoes and therefore \u2329determined\u232a to commence the purchase of horses in the morning from the indians in order to carry into execution the design \u2329we had formed of\u232a [<em class=\"hi\">WC: <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt C</a> had recomended in</em>] passing the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Rocky Mountains\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains\">rocky Mountains</a>. I now informed <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Cameahwait\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Cameahwait\">Cameahwait</a> of my intended expedition overland to the great river which lay in the plains beyond the mountains and told him that I wished to purchase 20 horses of himself and his people to convey our baggage. \u00a0\u00a0 he observed that the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Hidatsa Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Hidatsa%20Indians\">Minnetares</a> had stolen a great number of their horses this spring but hoped his people would spear me the number I wished. I also asked a [<em class=\"hi\">X: nother</em>] guide, he observed that he had no doubt but the old man who was with <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt. C.</a> would accompany us if we wished him and that he was better informed of the country than any of them. \u00a0\u00a0 matters being thus far arranged I directed the fiddle to be played and the party danced very merily much to the amusement and gratification of the natives, though I must confess that the state of my own mind at this moment did not well accord with the prevailing mirth as I somewhat feared that the caprice of the indians might suddenly induce them to withhold their horses from us without which my hopes of prosicuting my voyage to advantage was lost; however I determined to keep the indians in a good humour if possible, and to loose no time in obtaining the necessary number of horses. I directed the hunters to turn out early in the morning and indeavor to obtain some meat. I had nothing but a little parched corn to eat this evening.</p>\n               <p>\nThis morning <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt.
