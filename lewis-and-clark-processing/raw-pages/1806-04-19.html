I repremanded him more severaly for this peice of negligence than had been usual with me. I had the remaining horses well secured by picquits; they were extreemly wrestless and it required the attention of the whole guard through the night to retain them notwithstanding they were hubbled and picquted. \u00a0\u00a0 they frequently throwed themselves by the ropes by which they were confined. \u00a0\u00a0 all except one were stone horses <a href=\"#n32041903\" id=\"ln32041903\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> for the people in this neighbourhood do not understand the art of gelding them, and this is a season at which they are most vicious. \u00a0\u00a0 many of the natives remained about our camp all night.\n</p>\n            </span>\n         </div>\n         <div class=\"entry lc.jrn.1806-04-19.02 tei_div\" id=\"lc.jrn.1806-04-19.02\">\n            <span class=\"tei_sp_who_wc tei_sp\">\n               <h4 class=\"entry_author\">[Clark]</h4>\n               <span class=\"tei_ab\">\n                  <div class=\"entry_date\">\n                     <em class=\"hi\">April 19th 1806</em>\n                  </div><div class=\"clear_return\">\u00a0</div>\n               </span>\n               <p>\nthis morning early Some rain \u00a0\u00a0 had the Small Canoes hauled out to dry \u00a0\u00a0 every man Capable of Carrying a load Comencd the portage and by 5 P.
