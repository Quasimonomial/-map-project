it has the faggot bones, from which I have supposed it to be of the mullet kind. the tongue and pallate are smooth and it has no teeth. \u00a0\u00a0 it is by no means as good as the trout. \u00a0\u00a0 the trout <a href=\"#n20081902\" id=\"ln20081902\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> are the same which I first met with at the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Missouri River, Great Falls of the\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Missouri%20River%2C%20Great%20Falls%20of%20the\">falls of the Missouri</a>, they are larger than the speckled trout of our mountains and equally as well flavored.\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 The hunters returned this evening with two deer. \u00a0\u00a0 from what has \u2329already\u232a been said of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Shoshone Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Shoshone%20Indians\">Shoshones</a> it will be readily perceived that they live in a wretched stait of poverty. \u00a0\u00a0 yet notwithstanding their extreem poverty they are not only cheerfull but even gay, fond of gaudy dress and amusements; like most other Indians they are great egotists and frequently boast of heroic acts which they never performed. \u00a0\u00a0 they are also fond of games of wrisk. \u00a0\u00a0 they are frank, communicative, fair in dealing, generous with the little they possess, extreemly honest, and by no means beggarly. \u00a0\u00a0 each individual is his own sovereign master, and acts from the dictates of his own mind; the authority of the Cheif being nothing more than mere admonition supported by the influence which the propiety of his own exammplery conduct may have acquired him in the minds of the individuals who composed the band. \u00a0\u00a0 the title of cheif is not hereditary, nor can I learn that there is any cerimony of instalment, or other epoh in the life of a Cheif from which his title as such can be dated. \u00a0\u00a0 in fact every man is a chief, but all have not an equal influence on the minds of the other members of the community, and he who happens to enjoy the greatest share of confidence is the principal Chief. The <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Shoshone Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Shoshone%20Indians\">Shoshones</a> may be estimated as about 100 warriors, and about three times that number of woomen and children. \u00a0\u00a0 they have more children among them than I expected to have seen among a people who procure subsistence with such difficulty. \u00a0\u00a0 there are but few very old persons, nor did they appear to treat those with much tenderness or rispect. The man is the sole propryetor of his wives and daughters, and can barter or dispose of either as he thinks proper. \u00a0\u00a0 a plurality of wives is common among them, but these are not generally sisters as with the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Hidatsa Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Hidatsa%20Indians\">Minetares</a> &amp; <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Mandan Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Mandan%20Indians\">Mandans</a> but are purchased of different fathers. The father frequently disposes of his infant daughters in marriage to men who are grown or to men who have sons for whom they think proper to provide wives. \u00a0\u00a0 the compensation given in such cases usually consists of horses or mules which the father receives at the time of contract and converts to his own uce. \u00a0\u00a0 the girl remains with her parents untill she is conceived to have obtained the age of puberty which with them is considered to be about the age of 13 or 14 years. \u00a0\u00a0 the female at this age is surrendered to her sovereign lord and husband agreeably to contract, and with her is frequently restored by the father quite as much as he received in the first instance in payment for his daughter; but this is discretionary with the father. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Sacagawea\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Sacagawea\">Sah-car-gar-we-ah</a> had been thus disposed of before she was taken by the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Hidatsa Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Hidatsa%20Indians\">Minnetares</a>, or had arrived to the years of puberty. \u00a0\u00a0 the husband was yet living and with this band. \u00a0\u00a0 he was more than double her age and had two other wives. \u00a0\u00a0 he claimed her as his wife but said that as she had had a child by another man, who was <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Charbonneau, Toussaint\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Charbonneau%2C%20Toussaint\">Charbono</a>, that he did not want her. They seldom correct their children particularly the boys who soon become masters of their own acts. \u00a0\u00a0 they give as a reason that it cows and breaks the Sperit of the boy to whip him, and that he never recovers his independence of mind after he is grown. They treat their women but with little rispect, and compel them to perform every species of drudgery. \u00a0\u00a0 they collect the wild fruits and roots, attend to the horses or assist in that duty cook dreess the skins and make all their apparal, collect wood and make their fires, arrange and form their lodges, and when they travel pack the horses and take charge of all the baggage; in short the man dose little else except attend his horses hunt and fish. \u00a0\u00a0 the man considers himself degraded if he is compelled to walk any distance, and if he is so unfortunately poor as only to possess two horses \u00a0\u00a0 he rides the best himself and leavs the woman or women if he has more than one, to transport their baggage and children on the other, and to walk if the horse is unable to carry the additional weight of their persons\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 the chastity of their women is not held in high estimation, and the husband will for a trifle barter the companion of his bead for a night or longer if he conceives the reward adiquate; tho' they are not so importunate that we should caress their women as the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Sioux Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Sioux%20Indians\">siouxs</a> were and some of their women appear to be held more sacred than in any nation we have seen \u00a0\u00a0 I have requested the men to give them no cause of jealousy by having connection with their women without their knowledge, which with them strange as it may seem is considered as disgracefull to the husband as clandestine connections of a similar kind are among civilized nations. \u00a0\u00a0 to prevent this mutual exchange of good officies altogether I know it impossible to effect, particularly on the part of our young men whom some months abstanence have made very polite to those tawney damsels. \u00a0\u00a0 no evil has yet resulted and I hope will not from these connections.\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 notwithstanding the late loss of horses which this people sustained by the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Hidatsa Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Hidatsa%20Indians\">Minnetares</a> the stock of the band may be very safetly estimated at seven hundred of which they are perhaps about 40 coalts and half that number of mules.\u2014 these people are deminutive in stature, thick ankles, crooked legs, thick flat feet and in short but illy formed, at least much more so in general than any nation of Indians I ever saw. \u00a0\u00a0 their complexion is much that of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Sioux Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Sioux%20Indians\">Siouxs</a> or darker than the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Hidatsa Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Hidatsa%20Indians\">Minnetares</a>\n                  <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Mandan Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Mandan%20Indians\">mandands</a> or <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Shawnee Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Shawnee%20Indians\">Shawnees</a>. \u00a0\u00a0 generally both men and women wear their hair in a loos lank flow over the sholders and face; tho' I observed some few men who confined their hair in two equal cues hanging over each ear and drawnn in front of the body. the cue is formed with throngs of dressed lather or Otterskin aternately crossing each other. \u00a0\u00a0 at present most of them have cut short in the neck in consequence of the loss of their relations by the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Hidatsa Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Hidatsa%20Indians\">Minnetares</a>. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Cameahwait\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Cameahwait\">Cameahwait</a> has his cut close all over his head. \u00a0\u00a0 this constitutes their cerimony of morning for their deceased relations. \u00a0\u00a0 the dress of the men consists of a robe long legings, shirt, tippet and Mockersons, that of the women is also a robe, chemise, and Mockersons; sometimes they make use of short legings. \u00a0\u00a0 the ornements of both men and women are very similar, and consist of several species of sea shells, blue and white beads, bras and Iron arm bands, plaited cords of the sweet grass, and collars of leather ornamented with the quills of the porcupine dyed of various colours among which I observed the red, yellow, blue, and black. \u00a0\u00a0 the ear is purforated in the lower part to receive various ornaments but the nose is not, nor is the ear lasserated or disvigored for this purpose as among many nations. the men never mark their skins by birning, cuting, nor puncturing and introducing a colouring matter as many nations do. \u00a0\u00a0 there women sometimes puncture a small circle on their forehead nose or cheeks and thus introduce a black matter usually soot and grease which leaves an indelible stane. \u00a0\u00a0 tho' this even is by no means common. \u00a0\u00a0 their arms offensive and defensive consist in the bow and arrows sheild, some lances, and a weapon called by the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Chippewa Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Chippewa%20Indians\">Cippeways</a> who formerly used it, the pog-gar'-mag-gon'. <a href=\"#n20081903\" id=\"ln20081903\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> in fishing they employ wairs, gigs, and fishing hooks. \u00a0\u00a0 the salmon is the principal object of their pursuit. \u00a0\u00a0 they snair wolves and foxes. I was anxious to learn whether these people had the venerial, and made the enquiry through <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Charbonneau, Toussaint\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Charbonneau%2C%20Toussaint\">the intrepreter</a> and <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Sacagawea\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Sacagawea\">his wife</a>; the information was that they sometimes had it but I could not learn their remedy; they most usually die with it's effects. \u00a0\u00a0 this seems a strong proof that these disorders bothe gonaroehah and Louis venerae are naive disorders of America. \u00a0\u00a0 tho' hese people have suffered much by the small pox which is known to be imported and perhaps those other disorders might have been contracted from other indian tribes who by a round of communication might have obtained from the Europeans since it was introduced into that quarter of the globe. \u00a0\u00a0 but so much detatched on the other had from all communication with the whites that I think it most probable that those disorders are original with them. <a href=\"#n20081904\" id=\"ln20081904\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 from the middle of May to the firt of September these people reside on the waters of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Columbia River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Columbia%20River\">Columbia</a> where they consider themselves in perfect security from their enimies as they have not as yet ever found their way to this retreat; during this season the salmon furnish the principal part of their subsistence and as this firsh either perishes or returns about the 1st of September they are compelled at this season in surch of subsistence to resort to the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Missouri River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Missouri%20River\">Missouri</a>, in the vallies of which, there is more game even within the mountains. \u00a0\u00a0 here they move slowly down the river in order to collect and join other bands either of their own nation or the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Flathead Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Flathead%20Indians\">Flatheads</a>, and having become sufficiently strong as they conceive venture on the Eastern side of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Rocky Mountains\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains\">Rockey mountains</a> into the plains, where the buffaloe abound.\u00a0\u00a0  but they never leave the interior of the mountains while they can obtain a scanty subsistence, and always return as soon as they have acquired a good stock of dryed meat in the plains; when this stock is consumed they venture again into the plains; thus alternately obtaining their food at the risk of their lives and retiring to the mountains, while they consume it.\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 These people are now on the eve of their departure for the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Missouri River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Missouri%20River\">Missouri</a>, and inform us that they expect to be joined at or about the three forks by several bands of their own nation, and a band of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Flathead Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Flathead%20Indians\">Flatheads</a>. \u00a0\u00a0 as I am now two busily engaged to enter at once into a minute discription of the several articles which compose their dress, impliments of war hunting fishing &amp;c I shall pursue them at my leasure in the order they have here occurred to my mind, and have been mentioned. This morning <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">capt. Clark</a> continued his rout with his party, the Indians accompanying him as yesterday; he was obliged to feed them. \u00a0\u00a0 nothing remarkable happened during the day. \u00a0\u00a0 he was met by an Indian with two mules on this side of the dividing ridge at the foot of the mountain, the Indian had the politeness to offer <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt. C.</a> one of his mules to ride as he was on foot, which he accepted and gave the fellow a waistcoat as a reward for his politeness. \u00a0\u00a0 in the evening he reached the creek on this side of the Indian camp and halted for the night. <a href=\"#n20081905\" id=\"ln20081905\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[5]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 his hunters killed nothing today.
