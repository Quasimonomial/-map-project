M. a cloud arrose to the S. W. and shortly after came on attended with violent Thunder Lightning and hail &amp;c. \u00a0\u00a0 (see notes on diary of the weather for June). \u00a0\u00a0 soon after this storm was over <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Drouillard, George\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George\">Drewyer</a> and <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Field, Joseph\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Field%2C%20Joseph\">J. Fields</a> returned. \u00a0\u00a0 they were about 4 miles above us during the storm, the hail was of no uncommon size where they were. They had killed 9 Elk and three bear during their absence; one of the bear was the largest by far that we have yet seen; the skin appear to me to be as large as a common ox. \u00a0\u00a0 while hunting they saw a thick brushey bottom on the bank of the river where from the tracks along shore they suspected that there were bare concealed; they therefore landed without making any nois and climbed a leaning tree and placed themselves on it's branches about 20 feet above the ground, when thus securely fixed they gave a hoop and this large bear instantly rushed forward to the place from whence he had heard the human voice issue, when he arrived at the tree he made a short paus and <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Drouillard, George\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George\">Drewyer</a> shot him in the head. \u00a0\u00a0 it is worthy of remark that these bear never climb. \u00a0\u00a0 the fore feet of this bear measured nine inches across and the hind feet eleven and \u00be in length &amp; exclusive of the tallons and seven inches in width. \u00a0\u00a0 a bear came within thirty yards of our camp last night and eat up about thirty weight of buffaloe suit which was hanging on a pole. \u00a0\u00a0 my dog seems to be in a constant state of alarm with these bear and keeps barking all night. \u00a0\u00a0 soon after the storm this evening the water on this side of the river became of a deep crimson colour which I pesume proceeded from some stream above and on this side. \u00a0\u00a0 there is a kind of soft red stone in the bluffs and bottoms of the gullies in this neighbourhood which forms this colouring matter.\u2014 <a href=\"#n16062701\" id=\"ln16062701\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 <em class=\"hi\">At <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Lower portage camp\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Lower%20portage%20camp\">the lower camp</a>\n                  </em>. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt.
