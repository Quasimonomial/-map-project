Western side of mount hood where it takes it's source. <a href=\"#n31040102\" id=\"ln31040102\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 this mountain bears E from this place and is distant about 40 miles. \u00a0\u00a0 this information was corroborated by that of sundry other indians who visited us in the course of the day. \u00a0\u00a0 we were now convinced that there must be some other considerable river which flowed into the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Columbia River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Columbia%20River\">columbia</a> on it's south side below us which we have not yet seen, as the extensive valley on that side of the river lying between the mountainous country of the Coast and the Western mountains <a href=\"#n31040103\" id=\"ln31040103\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> must be watered by some stream which we had heretofore supposed was the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Sandy (Quicksand) River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Sandy%20%28Quicksand%29%20River\">quicksand river</a>. \u00a0\u00a0 but if it be a fact that the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Sandy (Quicksand) River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Sandy%20%28Quicksand%29%20River\">quicksand river</a> heads in <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Mount Hood (Timm, Falls Mountain)\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Mount%20Hood%20%28Timm%2C%20Falls%20Mountain%29\">Mount Hood</a> it must leave the valley within a few miles of it's entrance and runs nearly parallel with the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Columbia River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Columbia%20River\">Columbia river</a> upwards. \u00a0\u00a0 we indeavoured to ascertain by what steam the southern portion of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Columbia River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Columbia%20River\">Columbia</a> valley was watered but could obtain no satisfactory information of the natives on this head. \u00a0\u00a0 they informed us that the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Sandy (Quicksand) River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Sandy%20%28Quicksand%29%20River\">quicksand river</a> is navigable a short distance only in consequence of falls and rapids; and that no nation inhabits it.\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Pryor, Nathaniel Hale\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Pryor%2C%20Nathaniel%20Hale\">Sergt. Pryar</a> returned in the evening and reported that he had ascended the river six miles; that above the point at which it divides itself into two channels it is about 300 yds wide tho' the channel is not more than 50 yds and only 6 ft deep. \u00a0\u00a0 this is a large vollume of water to collect in so short a distance; I therefore think it probable that there are some large creeks falling into it from the S. W. the bed of this stream is formed entirely of quicksand; it's banks are low and at preasent overflows. \u00a0\u00a0 the water is turbid and current rapid.\u2014 the following are the courses taken by <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Pryor, Nathaniel Hale\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Pryor%2C%20Nathaniel%20Hale\">Sergt. Pryor</a>. S. 10\u00b0 W. 1 M. to a point on the Lard. side passing a large Island on Stard. S. 24\u00b0 E. 2 m. to the head of an Island near the Lard. shore S 33\u00b0 E. 4 m. to a stard. point passing several islands on the Lard. side and a creek 50 yds. wide on Stard at 1 \u00bd miles. \u00a0\u00a0 the river from hence appeared to bend to the East. \u00a0\u00a0 he heard falls of water. \u00a0\u00a0 several different tribes informed us that it heads at <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Mount Hood (Timm, Falls Mountain)\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Mount%20Hood%20%28Timm%2C%20Falls%20Mountain%29\">Mount Hood</a>. We were visited by several canoes of natives in the course of the day; most of whom were decending the river with their women and children. \u00a0\u00a0 they informed us that they resided at the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Columbia River, Cascades (Great Rapids, Great Shute)\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Columbia%20River%2C%20Cascades%20%28Great%20Rapids%2C%20Great%20Shute%29\">great rapids</a> and that their relations at that place were much streightened at that place for the want of food; that they had consumed their winter store of dryed fish and that those of the present season had not yet arrived. I could not learn wheather they took the Sturgeon but presume if they do it is in but small quantities as they complained much of the scarcity of food among them. \u00a0\u00a0 they informed us that the nations above them were in the same situation &amp; that they did not expect the Salmon to arrive untill the full of the next moon which happens on the 2d of May. <a href=\"#n31040104\" id=\"ln31040104\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 we did not doubt the varacity of these people who seemed to be on their way with their families and effects in surch of subsistence which they find it easy to procure in this fertile valley.\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 This information gave us much uneasiness with rispect to our future means of subsistence. \u00a0\u00a0 above falls or through plains from thence to the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Nez Perce Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians\">Chopunnish</a> there are no deer Antelope <a href=\"#n31040105\" id=\"ln31040105\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[5]</sup></a> nor Elk on which we can depend for subsistence; their horses are very poor most probably at this season, and if they have no fish their dogs must be in the same situation. \u00a0\u00a0 under these circumstances there seems to be but a gloomy prospect for subsistence on any terms; we therefore took it into serious consideration what measures we were to pursue on this occasion; it was at once deemed inexpedient to wait the arrival of the salmon as that would detain us so large a portion of the season that it is probable we should not reach the United States before the ice would close the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Missouri River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Missouri%20River\">Missouri</a>; or at all events would hazard our horses which we lelft in charge of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Nez Perce Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians\">Chopunnish</a>\n                   <a href=\"#n31040106\" id=\"ln31040106\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[6]</sup></a> who informed us that they intended passing the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Rocky Mountains\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains\">rocky mountains</a> to the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Missouri River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Missouri%20River\">Missouri</a> as early as the season would permit them wich is as we believe about the begining of May. \u00a0\u00a0 should these people leave their situation near <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clearwater (Flathead, Kooskooskee) River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Clearwater%20%28Flathead%2C%20Kooskooskee%29%20River\">kooskooske</a>\n                   <a href=\"#n31040107\" id=\"ln31040107\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[7]</sup></a> before our arrival we may probably find much difficulty in recovering our horses; without which there will be but little possibility of repassing the mountains; we are therefore determined to loose as little time as possible in geting to the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Nez Perce Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians\">Chopunnish</a> Village. \u00a0\u00a0 at 3 P. M. the hunters who were sent over the river returned having killed 4 Elk and two deer; the Elk were in good order but the deer extreemly poor. \u00a0\u00a0 they informed us that game is very plenty in that quarter. \u00a0\u00a0 the hunters on this side of the river also returned but had killed nothing; they saw a few Elk and deer. \u00a0\u00a0 there was also much sign of the black bear <a href=\"#n31040108\" id=\"ln31040108\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[8]</sup></a> seen on the other side of the river. \u00a0\u00a0 we sent a party to bring in the flesh of the Elk and deer that were killed. \u00a0\u00a0 they did not return this evening. I purchased a canoe from an Indian today for which I gave him six fathoms of wampum beads; <a href=\"#n31040109\" id=\"ln31040109\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[9]</sup></a> he seemed satisfyed with his bargain and departed in another canoe but shortly after returned and canceled the bargain; took his canoe and returned the beads. \u00a0\u00a0 this is frequently the case in their method of traiding and is deemed fair by them. The last evening and this morning were so cloudy that I could neither obtain any Lunar observations nor equal altitudes.\u2014</p>\n               <p>\n                  <span class=\"right\">\n                     <em class=\"hi\">Point of observation No. 55.</em>\n                  </span>\n               </p>\n               <p>\nAt our encampment on the N. side of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Columbia River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Columbia%20River\">Columbia</a> opposite the upper entrance of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Sandy (Quicksand) River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Sandy%20%28Quicksand%29%20River\">Quicksand river</a>\n               </p>\n               <div class=\"p\">\n                  <div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class=\" tei_table\">\n                     <tr class=\" tei_tr\">\n                        <td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\" class=\" tei_td rowspan_1 colspan_1\"><span class=\"cell_contents\">Observed Meridian Altitude of \u2609's U.

I could not lern whether they took Sturgion but prosume if they do it is in but Small quantities as they complain much of the Scercity of food among them, they informed us that the nativs above them were in the Same Situation, and that they did not expect the Salmon to arrive untill the full of the next moon which happens on the 2nd of May. \u00a0\u00a0 we did not doubt the veracity of those people who Seamed to be on their way with their families and effects in serch of Subsistence which they find it easy to precure in this fertile Vally\u2014. This information givs us much uneasiness with respect to our future means of Subsistence, above the falls, on through the Plains from thence to the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Nez Perce Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians\">Chopunnish</a> there are no Deer Antilopes or Elk on which we could depend for Subsistence; their horses are very poor most probably at this Season, and if they have no fish their dogs must be in the Same Situation. \u00a0\u00a0 under these circumstances there Seams to be a gloomey prospect for Subsistence on any terms; we therefore took it into Serious Consideration what measure we were to pursue on this Occasion; it was at once deemed inexpedient to waite the arival of the Salmon as that would detain us So long a portion of the Season that it is probable we Should not reach the U States before the ice would close the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Missouri River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Missouri%20River\">Missouri</a>; or at all events would hazard our horses which we left in charge of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Nez Perce Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians\">Chopunnish</a> who informed us that they intended passing the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Rocky Mountains\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains\">Rocky Mountains</a> to the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Missouri River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Missouri%20River\">Missouri</a> as early as the Season would permit them which is about the first of May.
