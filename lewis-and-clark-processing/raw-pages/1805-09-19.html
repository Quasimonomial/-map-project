About 8 this morning we set out, and proceeded on in our way over the mountains; the sun shining warm and pleasant. We travelled a \nwest course, and about 12 o'clock halted at a spring to take a little more soup. The snow is chiefly gone except on the north points of the high mountains. At 2 P. M. we again went on, and descended a steep mountain into a cove on our left hand, where there is a large creek, <a href=\"#n22091916\" id=\"ln22091916\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[16]</sup></a> which here runs towards the east. The hills on each side, along which the trail or path passes, are very steep. One of our horses fell down the precipice about 100 feet, and was not killed, nor much hurt: the reason was, that there is no bottom below, and the precipice, the only bank, which the creek has; therefore the horse pitched into the water, without meeting with any intervening object, which could materially injure him. We made 17 miles this day and encamped on a small branch of the creek. Having heard nothing from our hunters, we again supped upon some of our portable soup. The men are becoming lean and debilitated, on account of the scarcity and poor quality of the provisions \non which we subsist: our horses' feet are also becoming very sore. We have, however, some hopes of getting soon out of this horrible mountainous desert, as we have discovered the appearance of a valley or level part of the country about 40 miles ahead. When this discovery was made there was as much joy and rejoicing among the corps, as happens among passengers at \nsea, who have experienced a dangerous and protracted voyage, when they first discover land on the long looked for coast.\n\n\n</p>\n            </span>\n         </div>\n         <div class=\"entry lc.jrn.1805-09-19.06 tei_div\" id=\"lc.jrn.1805-09-19.06\">\n            <span class=\"tei_sp_who_jw tei_sp\">\n               <h4 class=\"entry_author\">[Whitehouse]</h4>\n               <span class=\"tei_ab\">\n                  <div class=\"clear_return\">\u00a0</div>\n               </span>\n               <p>\n                  <em class=\"hi\">Thursday 19th Sept. 1805</em>. \u00a0\u00a0 a clear pleasant morning. \u00a0\u00a0 we Set out as usal and assended up to the top of Sd. mout. and discovered a plain in a valley about 20 miles from us where we expect is the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Columbia River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Columbia%20River\">Columbian River</a> which puts us in good Spirits again. \u00a0\u00a0 we descended down the mountn. which was verry Steep descent, for about three miles. \u00a0\u00a0 then assended another as bad as any we have ever been up before. \u00a0\u00a0 it made the Sweat run off of our horses &amp; ourselves. \u00a0\u00a0 on the top the ground was froze a little and the ground mostly covred with Snow. \u00a0\u00a0 the Spruce pine &amp; bolsom timber continues on these motn. as usal. \u00a0\u00a0 Some places thick bushes. \u00a0\u00a0 we descd. the mot. down in a narrow valley where we found a run of water and halted to bate our horses and to drink a little portable Soup. \u00a0\u00a0 one of the men killed a fessent. \u00a0\u00a0 their is not any kind of game or Sign of any to be Seen in these mout. \u00a0\u00a0 Scarsely any birds itself. \u00a0\u00a0 we delayed about 2 hours and proceeded on \u00a0\u00a0 descended the mountain about 4 miles came to a creek running about East. \u00a0\u00a0 we followed up the creek. \u00a0\u00a0 a bad peace of the road, Some places along Side of the mountn. which is high &amp; Steep on each Side of the creek. \u00a0\u00a0 one of our horses fell backward and roled about 100 feet down where it was nearly Steep and a Solid rock &amp; dashed against the rock in the creek, with a load of Ammunition. \u00a0\u00a0 but the powder being in canisters did not git damaged nor the horse killed, but hurt. \u00a0\u00a0 we proceeded on. \u00a0\u00a0 Came about 17 miles this day and Camped at a run in Sd. mount., our course this day was generally west. \u00a0\u00a0 the timber continues as usal. \u00a0\u00a0 we Suped a little portable Soup. \u00a0\u00a0 the most of the party is weak and feeble Suffering with hunger. \u00a0\u00a0 our horses feet \nare gitting Sore and fall away in these mountains, but we are in hopes to git out of them Soon.</p>\n               <p>\nThursday Septemr 19th \u00a0\u00a0 A clear pleasant morning, we set out early, &amp; ascended the top of the Mountain on the side of which we lay last night, We discovered from the Top of this mountain; a plain which lay in a Valley, which we suppose to lay about 20 Miles from us, We expect this plain is where the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Columbia River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Columbia%20River\">Columbia River</a> is, this revived the drooping spirits of our party. \u00a0\u00a0 We descended down this Mountain, which we found dangerous for about 3 Miles, We then ascended another Mountain; which was as bad to ascend as any Mountain we had yet seen, this was very fataigueing to ourselves &amp; horses, \nthe ground was covered with Snow &amp; froze, The Pine &amp; Spruce, balsam Fir timber on the Top of these Mountains, &amp; in some places thick bushes.\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 We descended this Mountain &amp; came down into a narrow Valley, where we \nfound a run of water. \u00a0\u00a0 We halted at that place to rest our horses &amp; to eat some portable soup. \u00a0\u00a0 One of our Men here killed a Pheasant, There was no kind of Game to be seen in these Mountains, &amp; scarcely any Birds. \u00a0\u00a0 We delayed about 2 hours\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 &amp; proceeded on, &amp; descended a mountain about four Miles, and arrived at a Creek, whose course run east, we pursued our way up the Creek on a bad piece of Road, some places running along close \nunder the Mountain; which is high &amp; steep on both sides of the Creek, One of our horses fell backwards, &amp; rolled about 100 feet down a steep solid Rock, and dashed against a Rock, in the Creek with his load; which was Ammunition; The Powder, being in leaden Cannisters, was not damaged, nor the horse killed, but much hurt.\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 We proceeded on, and encamped at a run of Water in the said Mountain; In the evening, our party had a little portable Soup made to subsist on. \u00a0\u00a0 They all are very weak &amp; feeble &amp; suffer much for want of Provisions, Our horses feet are very much worn, &amp; they have fallen away very much, since we came into the Mountains.</p>\n               <p>\nThe Men still seem contented; &amp; flatter themselves of soon getting out of the Mountains. \u00a0\u00a0 Our course during this day, has been chiefly a West course &amp; we came about 17 Miles\u2014\n\n\n\n</p>\n            </span>\n         </div>\n      \n      \n         <div class=\"notes  tei_div\">\n            <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"n22091901\">1.
