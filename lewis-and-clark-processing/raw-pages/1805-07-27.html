W. fork</a>, which I most certainly prefer as it's direction is much more promising than any other. \u00a0\u00a0 beleiving this to be an essential point in the geography of this western part of the Continent I determined to remain at all events untill I obtained the necessary data for fixing it's latitude Longitude &amp;c. \u00a0\u00a0 after fixing my camp I had the canoes all unloaded and the baggage stoed away and securely covered on shore, and then permitted several men to hunt. I walked down to the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Madison River (Middle Fork)\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Madison%20River%20%28Middle%20Fork%29\">middle fork</a> and examined and compared it with the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Jefferson River (North, Southwest Fork)\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Jefferson%20River%20%28North%2C%20Southwest%20Fork%29\">S. W. fork</a> but could not satisfy myself which was the largest stream of the two, in fact they appeared as if they had been cast in the same mould there being no difference in character or size, therefore to call either of these streams the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Missouri River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Missouri%20River\">Missouri</a> would be giving it a preference wich it's size dose not warrant as it is not larger then the other. \u00a0\u00a0 they are each 90 yds. wide. \u00a0\u00a0 in these meadows I saw a number of the duckanmallad <a href=\"#n17072706\" id=\"ln17072706\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[6]</sup></a> with their young which are now nearly grown. Currants of every species as well as goosberries are found her[e] in great abundance and perfection. \u00a0\u00a0 a large black goosberry <a href=\"#n17072707\" id=\"ln17072707\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[7]</sup></a> which grows to the hight of five or six feet is also found here. \u00a0\u00a0 this is the growth of the bottom lands and is found also near the little rivulets which make down from the hills and mountains \u00a0\u00a0 it puts up many stems from the same root, some of which are partialy branched and all reclining. \u00a0\u00a0 the berry is attatched seperately by a long peduncle to the stem from which they hang pendant underneath. \u00a0\u00a0 the berry is of an ovate form smooth as large as the common garden goosberry when arrived at maturity and is as black as jet, tho' the pulp is of a cimson colour. \u00a0\u00a0 this fruit is extreemly asced. \u00a0\u00a0 the leaf resembles the common goosberry in form but is reather larger and somewhat proportioned to the superior size of it's stem when compared with the common goosberry. \u00a0\u00a0 the stem is covered with very sharp thorns or bryers. \u00a0\u00a0 below the tree forks as we passed this morning I observed many collections of the mud nests of the small martin attatched to the smooth face of the limestone rocks sheltered by projections of the same rock above. Our hunters returned this evening with 6 deer 3 Otter and a musk rat. \u00a0\u00a0 they informed me that they had seen great numbers of Antelopes, and much sign of beaver Otter deer Elk, &amp;c. \u00a0\u00a0 at 3 P. M. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt clark</a> arrived very sick with a high fever on him and much fatiegued and exhausted. \u00a0\u00a0 he informed me that he was very sick all last night had a high fever and frequent chills &amp; constant aking pains in all his mustles. \u00a0\u00a0 this morning notwithstanding his indisposition he pursued his intended rout to the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Madison River (Middle Fork)\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Madison%20River%20%28Middle%20Fork%29\">middle fork</a> about 8 miles and finding no recent sign of Indians rested about an hour and came down the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Madison River (Middle Fork)\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Madison%20River%20%28Middle%20Fork%29\">middle fork</a> to this place. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt.

C's</a> indisposition was a further inducement for my remaining here a couple of days; I therefore informed the men of my intention, and they put their deer skins in the water in order to prepare them for dressing tomorrow. \u00a0\u00a0 we begin to feel considerable anxiety with rispect to the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Shoshone Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Shoshone%20Indians\">Snake</a> Indians. \u00a0\u00a0 if we do not find them or some other nation who have horses I fear the successfull issue of our voyage will be very doubtfull or at all events much more difficult in it's accomplishment. \u00a0\u00a0 we are now several hundred miles within the bosom of this wild and mountanous country, where game may rationally be expected shortly to become scarce and subsistence precarious without any information with rispect to the country not knowing how far these mountains continue, or wher to direct our course to pass them to advantage or intersept a navigable branch of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Columbia River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Columbia%20River\">Columbia</a>, or even were we on such an one the probability is that we should not find any timber within these mountains large enough for canoes if we judge from the portion of them through which we have passed. \u00a0\u00a0 however I still hope for the best, and intend taking a tramp myself in a few days to find these yellow gentlemen if possible. \u00a0\u00a0 my two principal consolations are that from our present position it is impossible that the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Jefferson River (North, Southwest Fork)\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Jefferson%20River%20%28North%2C%20Southwest%20Fork%29\">S.
