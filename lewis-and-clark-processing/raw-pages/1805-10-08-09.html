M. we set out, &amp; proceeded on with our Canoes down the River on our Voyage; we saw a number of the Indians horses feeding on the side of hills, as we passed along, We also passed over several bad rapids, where our Canoes took in Water, occasion'd by the Waves dashing over the sides of them.\u2014</p>\n               <p>\nThe Current of the River has run rapid the most part of the way this day, &amp; in some places we found the River very deep. \u00a0\u00a0 We passed by large Clifts of rocks &amp; naked hills lying on both sides of the River.\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 About 12 oClock A.

This Camp was situated at the lower end of an Island, where lay some rapids. \u00a0\u00a0 We halted here for a short time, &amp; purchased some more Salmon and white bread Roots.\u2014</p>\n               <p>\nThese Indians were also belonging to the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Flathead Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Flathead%20Indians\">flatt head</a> Nation.\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 We proceeded on and went but a short distance, and took in the Indians that set out this morning by land. \u00a0\u00a0 we then continued on our Voyage, and as we were descending a rocky rapid at the foot of an Island on which were some Indian camps, One of our Canoes struck a rock, and wheeled round, where she again Struck \u2329a\u232a another rock and Cracked the bottom of it, &amp; was near splitting in two; &amp; threw the Man who was steering her overboard, but he with great difficulty got to her again\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 This Canoe soon filled with water &amp; hung on the rock in a perilous situation. \u00a0\u00a0 Some of the Men on board of her, could not swim; &amp; those Men that could, had no chance of saving themselves, the Waves ran so high, and the current was so rapid, that they must have been dashed against Rocks that lay below them a short distance &amp; in all probability must have drownded.\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 It was very fortunate for those Men, that an Indian who saw their situation from the Island we passed last, came to their assistance with a small Canoe &amp; One of our Canoes went also, &amp; took out some of the loading &amp; landed it safe on the Shore.\u2014</p>\n               <p>\nOur officers had one of the other Canoes unloaded and the Men went, and took out the remainder of the loading from on board that Canoes, which had been stove; and got it all on the Shore below the rapid, They experienced much difficulty in unloading the Canoe in the Rapids, the Current being so very Swift &amp; strong. \u00a0\u00a0 We found the whole of the loading got out of that Canoe, wet &amp; we lost some small Articles of the loading.\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 Our party were all rejoiced at the fortunate escape that the Men made that were in the Canoe, &amp; think that nothing but the Interference of providence was the occasion. \u00a0\u00a0 In the Evening a number of the Natives came to Visit us, &amp; behaved with a great deal of friendship to us all, they continued some time with us &amp; took a friendly leave &amp; departed for their Camps. \u00a0\u00a0 These Indians also belonged to the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Flathead Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Flathead%20Indians\">Flatt-head</a> Nation.\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 We came about 18 Miles this day before the accident happen'd to the Canoe,\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 &amp;
