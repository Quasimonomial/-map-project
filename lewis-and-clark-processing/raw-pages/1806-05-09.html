Collecting our horses detained us untill 9 A. M. when we charged our packhorses and set out. \u00a0\u00a0 our rout lay through a level rich country similar to that of yesterday; <a href=\"#n34050901\" id=\"ln34050901\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> at the distance of 6 miles we arrived at the lodge of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Twisted Hair (Walamotinin)\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Twisted%20Hair%20%28Walamotinin%29\">twisted hair</a>; this habitation was built in the usual form with sticks mats and dryed hay, and contained 2 firs and about 12 persons. \u00a0\u00a0 even at this small habitation there was an appendage of the soletary lodge, the retreat of the tawny damsels when nature causes them to be drive into coventry; <a href=\"#n34050902\" id=\"ln34050902\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> here we halted as had been previously concerted, and one man with 2 horses accompayed the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Twisted Hair (Walamotinin)\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Twisted%20Hair%20%28Walamotinin%29\">twisted hair</a> to the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Canoe Camp (Idaho)\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Canoe%20Camp%20%28Idaho%29\">canoe camp</a>, <a href=\"#n34050903\" id=\"ln34050903\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> about 4 ms. in quest of the saddles. \u00a0\u00a0 the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Twisted Hair (Walamotinin)\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Twisted%20Hair%20%28Walamotinin%29\">Twisted hair</a> sent two young men in surch of our horses agreeably to his promis. The country along the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Rocky Mountains\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains\">rocky mountains</a> for several hundred miles in length and about 50 in width is level extreemly fertile and in many parts covered with a tall and open growth of the longleafed pine. \u00a0\u00a0 near the watercouses the hills are steep and lofty tho' are covered with a good soil not remarkably stony <a href=\"#n34050904\" id=\"ln34050904\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> and possess more timber than the level country. \u00a0\u00a0 the bottom lands on the watercourses are reather narrow and confined tho' fertile &amp; seldom inundated. \u00a0\u00a0 this country would form an extensive settlement; the climate appears quite as mild as that of similar latitude on the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Atlantic Ocean\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Atlantic%20Ocean\">Atlantic</a> coast if not more so and it cannot be otherwise than healthy; it possesses a fine dry pure air. \u00a0\u00a0 the grass and many plants are now upwards of knee high. I have no doubt but this tract of country if cultivated would produce in great abundance every article essentially necessary to the comfort and subsistence of civillized man. \u00a0\u00a0 to it's present inhabitants nature seems to have dealt with a liberal hand, for she has distributed a great variety of esculent plants over the face of the country which furnish them a plentifull store of provision; these are acquired with but little toil, and when prepared after the method of the natives afford not only a nutricious but an agreeable food. \u00a0\u00a0 among other roots those called by them the Quawmash and Cows are esteemed the most agreeable and valuable as they are also the most abundant. \u00a0\u00a0 the cows is a knobbed root of an irregularly rounded form not unlike the Gensang <a href=\"#n34050905\" id=\"ln34050905\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[5]</sup></a> in form and consistence. \u00a0\u00a0 this root they collect, rub of a thin black rhind which covers it and pounding it expose it in cakes to the sun. \u00a0\u00a0 these cakes ate about an inch and \u00bc thick and 6 by 18 in width, when dryed they either eat this bread alone without any further preperation, or boil it and make a thick muselage; the latter is most common and much the most agreeable. \u00a0\u00a0 the flavor of this root is not very unlike the gensang.\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 this root they collect as early as the snows disappear in the spring and continue to collect it untill the quawmash supplys it's place which happens about the latter end of June. \u00a0\u00a0 the quawmash is also collected for a few weaks after it first makes it's appearance in the spring, but when the scape <a href=\"#n34050906\" id=\"ln34050906\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[6]</sup></a> appears it is no longer fit for use untill the seed are ripe which happens about the time just mentioned, and then the cows declines. \u00a0\u00a0 the latter is also frequently dryed in the sun and pounded afterwards and then used in making soope.\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 I observed a few trees of the larch and a few small bushes of the balsam fir near the lodge of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Twisted Hair (Walamotinin)\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Twisted%20Hair%20%28Walamotinin%29\">Twisted hair</a>. \u00a0\u00a0 at 2 P.
