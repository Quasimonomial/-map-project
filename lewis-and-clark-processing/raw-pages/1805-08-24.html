I now produced some battle axes which I had made at <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Fort%20Mandan%20%28N.%20Dak.%29\">Fort Mandan</a> with which they were much pleased. \u00a0\u00a0 knives also seemed a great demand among them. I soon purchased three horses and a mule. \u00a0\u00a0 for each horse I gave an ax a knife handkercheif and a little paint; &amp; for the mule the addition of a knife a shirt handkercheif and a pair of legings; at this price which was quite double that given for the horses, the fellow who sold him made a merit of having bestoed me one of his mules. I consider this mule a great acquisition. These Indians soon told me that they had no more horses for sale and I directed the party to prepare to set out. I had now nine horses and a mule, and two which I had hired made twelve these I had loaded and the Indian women took the ballance of the baggage. I had given the Interpreter some articles with which to purchase a horse for the woman which he had obtained. \u00a0\u00a0 at twelve Oclock we set out and passed the river below the forks, directing our rout towards the cove along the track formerly mentioned. <a href=\"#n21082401\" id=\"ln21082401\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 most of the horses were heavily laden, and it appears to me that it will require at least 25 horses to convey our baggage along such roads as I expect we shall be obliged to pass in the mountains. I had now the inexpressible satisfaction to find myself once more under way with all my baggage and party. \u00a0\u00a0 an Indian had the politeness to offer me one of his horses to ride which I accepted with cheerfullness as it enabled me to attend better to the march of the party. I had reached the lower part of the cove when an Indian rode up and informed me that one of my men was very sick and unable to come on. I directed the party to halt at a small run which falls into the creek on Lard. at the lower part of the Cove and rode back about 2 Miles where I found <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Weiser, Peter\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Weiser%2C%20Peter\">Wiser</a> very ill with a fit of the cholic. I sent <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Ordway, John\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Ordway%2C%20John\">Sergt. Ordway</a> who had remained with him for some water and gave him a doze of the essence of Peppermint and laudinum <a href=\"#n21082402\" id=\"ln21082402\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> which in the course of half an hour so far recovered him that he was enabled to ride my horse and I proceeded on foot and rejoined the party. \u00a0\u00a0 the sun was yet an hour high but the Indians who had for some time impatiently waited my return at length unloaded and turned out their horses and my party had followed there example. \u00a0\u00a0 as it was so late and the Indians had prepared their camp for the night I thought it best to acquiess and determined also to remain. <a href=\"#n21082403\" id=\"ln21082403\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 we had traveled only about six miles. \u00a0\u00a0 after we encamped we had a slight shower of rain. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Goodrich, Silas\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Goodrich%2C%20Silas\">Goodrich</a> who is our principal fisherman caught several fine trout. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Drouillard, George\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George\">Drewyer</a> came to us late in the evening and had not killed anything. I gave the Indians who were absolutely engaged in transporting the baggage, a little corn as they had nothing to eat. I told <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Cameahwait\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Cameahwait\">Cameahwait</a> that my stock of provision was too small to indulge all his people with provision and recommended it to him to advise such as were not assisting us with our baggage to go on to their camp to morrow and wait our arrival; which he did accordingly. <em class=\"hi\">\n                     <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Cameahwait\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Cameahwait\">Cameahwait</a>\n                  </em> literally translated is <em class=\"hi\">one who never walks.</em> \u00a0\u00a0 he told me that his nation had also given him another name by which he was signalized as a warrior which was <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Cameahwait\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Cameahwait\">Too-et'-te-con'-e</a> or <em class=\"hi\">black gun.</em> \u00a0\u00a0 these people have many names in the course of their lives, particularly if they become distinguished characters. \u00a0\u00a0 for it seems that every important event by which they happen to distinguish themselves intitles them to claim another name which is generally scelected by themselves and confirmed by the nation. \u00a0\u00a0 those distinguishing acts are the killing and scalping an enemy, the killing a white bear, leading a party to war who happen to be successfull either in destroying their enemies or robing them of their horses, or individually stealing the horses of an enemy. \u00a0\u00a0 these are considered acts of equal heroism among them, and that of killing an enemy without scalping him is considered of no importance; in fact the whole honour seems to be founded in the act of scalping, for if a man happens to slay a dozen of his enemies in action and others get the scalps or first lay their hand on the dead person the honor is lost to him who killed them and devolves on those who scalp or first touch them. <a href=\"#n21082404\" id=\"ln21082404\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Among the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Shoshone Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Shoshone%20Indians\">Shoshones</a>, as well as all the Indians of America, bravery is esteemed the primary virtue; nor can any one become eminent among them who has not at some period of his life given proofs of his possessing this virtue. \u00a0\u00a0 with them there can be no preferment without some warelike achievement, and so completely interwoven is this principle with the earliest Elements of thought that it will in my opinion prove a serious obstruction to the restoration of a general peace among the nations of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Missouri River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Missouri%20River\">Missouri</a>. \u00a0\u00a0 while at <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Fort%20Mandan%20%28N.%20Dak.%29\">Fort Mandan</a> I was one day addressing some cheifs of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Hidatsa Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Hidatsa%20Indians\">Minetares</a> wo visited us and pointing out to them the advantages of a state of peace with their neighbours over that of war in which they were engaged. \u00a0\u00a0 the Chiefs who had already geathered their havest of larals, and having forceably felt in many instances some of those inconveniences attending a state of war which I pointed out, readily agreed with me in opinion. \u00a0\u00a0 a young fellow under the full impression of the Idea I have just suggested asked me if they were in a state of peace with all their neighbours what the nation would do for Cheifs?, and added that the cheifs were now oald and must shortly die and that the nation could not exist without cheifs. \u00a0\u00a0 taking as granted that there could be no other mode devised for making Cheifs but that which custom had established through the medium of warlike acievements.</p>\n               <p>\nThe few guns which the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Shoshone Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Shoshone%20Indians\">Shoshones</a> have are reserved for war almost exclusively and the bow and arrows are used in hunting. I have seen a few skins among these people which have almost every appearance of the common sheep. \u00a0\u00a0 they inform me that they finde this animal <a href=\"#n21082405\" id=\"ln21082405\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[5]</sup></a> on the high mountains to the West and S. W. of them. \u00a0\u00a0 it is about the size of the common sheep, the wool is reather shorter and more intermixed with long hairs particularly on the upper part of the neck. \u00a0\u00a0 these skins have been so much woarn that I could not form a just Idea of the animal or it's colour. \u00a0\u00a0 the Indians however inform me that it is white and that it's horns are lunated comprest twisted and bent backward as those of the common sheep. \u00a0\u00a0 the texture of the skin appears to be that of the sheep. I am now perfectly convinced that the sheep as well as the Bighorn exist in these mountains. [<em class=\"hi\">WC?: <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt. C</a> Saw one at a distance to day\u2014</em>]</p>\n               <p>\nThe usual caparison of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Shoshone Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Shoshone%20Indians\">Shoshone</a> horse is a halter and sadle. \u00a0\u00a0 the 1st consists either of a round plated or twisted cord of six or seven strands of buffaloe's hair, or a throng of raw hide made pliant by pounding and rubing. \u00a0\u00a0 these cords of bufaloe's hair are about the size of a man's finger and remarkably strong. \u00a0\u00a0 this is the kind of halter which is prefered by them. \u00a0\u00a0 the halter of whatever it may be composed is always of great length and is never taken from the neck of the horse which they commonly use at any time. \u00a0\u00a0 it is first attatched at one end about the neck of the horse with a knot that will not slip, it is then brought down to his under jaw and being passed through the mouth imbaces the under jaw and tonge in a simple noose formed by crossing the rope inderneath the jaw of the horse. \u00a0\u00a0 this when mounted he draws up on the near side of the horse's neck and holds in the left hand, suffering it to trail at a great distance behind him sometimes the halter is attatched so far from the end that while the shorter end serves him to govern his horse, the other trails on the grond as before mentioned. \u00a0\u00a0 they put their horses to their full speed with those cords trailing on the ground. \u00a0\u00a0 when they turn out the horse to graze the noose is mearly loosed from his mouth. \u00a0\u00a0 the saddle is made of wood and covered with raw hide which holds the parts very firmly together. \u00a0\u00a0 it is made like the pack saddles in uce among the French and Spaniards. \u00a0\u00a0 it consists of two flat thin boards which fit the sides of the horses back, and are held frirm by two peices which are united to them behind and before on the outer side and which rise to a considerable hight terminating sometimes in flat horizontal points extending outwards, and alwas in an accute angle or short bend underneath the upper part of these peices. \u00a0\u00a0 a peice of buffaloe's skin with the hair on, is usually put underneath the saddle; and very seldom any covering on the saddle [<em class=\"hi\">NB: but when they ride they throw on a piece of Skin</em>]. \u00a0\u00a0 stirrups when used are made of wood and covered with leather. \u00a0\u00a0 these are generally used by the elderly men and women; the young men scarcely ever use anything more than a small pad of dressed leather stuffed with hair, which is confined with a leather thong passing arond the body of the horse in the manner of a girth. \u00a0\u00a0 they frequently paint their favorite horses, and cut their ears in various shapes. \u00a0\u00a0 they also decorate their mains and tails, which they never draw or trim, with the feathers of birds, and sometimes suspend at the breast of the horse the finest ornaments they possess. \u00a0\u00a0 the Spanish bridle is prefered by them when they can obtain them, but they never dispence with the cord about the neck of the horse, which serves them to take him with more ease when he is runing at large. They are excellent horsemen and extreemly expert in casting the cord about the neck of a horse. [<em class=\"hi\">NB: Make a noose &amp; catch him running &amp;c</em>] the horses that have been habituated to be taken with the cord in this way, however wild they may appear at first, surrender the moment they feel the cord about their necks.\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 There are no horses in this quarter which can with propriety be termed wild. \u00a0\u00a0 there are some few which have been left by the indians at large for so great a length of time that they have become shye, but they all shew marks of having been in possession of man. \u00a0\u00a0 such is that one which <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt.
