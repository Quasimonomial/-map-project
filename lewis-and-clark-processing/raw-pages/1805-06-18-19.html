fastened her securely, drove out the plugs of the gage holes of her bottom and covered her with bushes and driftwood to shelter her from the sun. I now scelected a place for a cash and set tree men at work to complete it, and employed all others except those about the waggons, in overhawling airing and repacking our indian goods ammunicion, provision and stores of every discription which required inspection. \u00a0\u00a0 examined the frame of my Iron boat and found all the parts complete except one screw, which the ingenuity of <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Shields, John\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Shields%2C%20John\">Sheilds</a> can readily replace, a resource which we have very frequent occasion for. \u00a0\u00a0 about 12 O'Clk. the hunters returned; they had killed 10 deer but no Elk. I begin to fear that we shall have some difficulty in procuring skins for the boat. I wold prefer those of the Elk because I beleive them more durable and strong than those of the Buffaloe, and that they will not shrink so much in drying. \u00a0\u00a0 we saw a herd of buffaloe come down to water at the sulpher spring this evening, I dispatched some hunters to kill some of them, and a man also for a cask of mineral water. \u00a0\u00a0 the hunters soon killed two of them in fine order and returned with a good quantity of the flesh, having left the remainder in a situation that it will not spoil provided the wolves do not visit it. The waggons are completed this evening, and appear as if they would answer the purpose very well if the axetrees prove sufficiently strong. \u00a0\u00a0 the wind blew violently this evening, as they frequently do in this open country where there is not a tree to brake or oppose their force. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Sacagawea\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Sacagawea\">The Indian woman</a> is recovering fast \u00a0\u00a0 she set up the greater part of the day and walked out for the fist time since she arrived here; she eats hartily and is free from fever or pain.
