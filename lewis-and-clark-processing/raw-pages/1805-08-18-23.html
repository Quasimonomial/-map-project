I soon obtained three very good horses for which I gave an uniform coat, a pair of legings, a few handkerchiefs, three knives and some other small articles the whole of which did not cost more than about 20$ in the U' States. \u00a0\u00a0 the Indians seemed quite as well pleased with their bargin as I was. \u00a0\u00a0 the men also purchased one for an old checked shirt a pair of old legings and a knife. \u00a0\u00a0 two of those I purchased <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt. C.</a> took on with him. at 10 A. M. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt. Clark</a> departed with his detatchment and all the Indians except 2 men and 2 women who remained with us. Two of the inferior chiefs were a little displeased at not having received a present equivolent to that given the first Chief. \u00a0\u00a0 to releive this difficulty <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt. Clark</a> bestoed a couple of his old coats on them and I promised that if they wer active in assisting me over the mountains with horses that I would give them an additional present; this seemed perfectly to satisfy them and they all set out in a good humour. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt. Clark</a> encamped this evening near the narrow pass between the hills on <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Beaverhead (Jefferson) River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Beaverhead%20%28Jefferson%29%20River\">Jefferson's river</a> in the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Shoshone Cove\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Shoshone%20Cove\">Shoshone Cove</a>. <a href=\"#n20081801\" id=\"ln20081801\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> his hunters killed one deer which the party with the aid of the Indians readily consumed in the course of the evening.\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 after there departure this morning I had all the stores and baggage of every discription opened and aired. \u00a0\u00a0 and began the operation of forming the packages in proper parsels for the purpose of transporting them on horseback. \u00a0\u00a0 the rain in the evening compelled me to desist from my operations. I had the raw hides put in the water in order to cut them in throngs proper for lashing the packages and forming the necessary geer for pack horses, a business which I fortunately had not to learn on this occasion. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Drouillard, George\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George\">Drewyer</a> Killed one deer this evening. \u00a0\u00a0 a beaver was also caught by one of the party. I had the net arranged and set this evening to catch some trout which we could see in great abundance at the bottom of the river. This day I completed my thirty first year, and conceived that I had in all human probability now existed about half the period which I am to remain in this Sublunary world. I reflected that I had as yet done but little, very little indeed, to further the hapiness of the human race, or to advance the information of the succeeding generation. I viewed with regret the many hours I have spent in indolence, and now soarly feel the want of that information which those hours would have given me had they been judiciously expended. \u00a0\u00a0 but since they are past and cannot be recalled, I dash from me the gloomy thought and resolved in future, to redouble my exertions and at least indeavour to promote those two primary objects of human existence, by giving them the aid of that portion of talents which nature and fortune have bestoed on me; or in future, to live for <em class=\"hi\">mankind,</em> as I have heretofore lived <em class=\"hi\">for myself.\u2014</em>\n               </p>\n            </span>\n         </div>\n         <div class=\"entry lc.jrn.1805-08-18.02 tei_div\" id=\"lc.jrn.1805-08-18.02\">\n            <span class=\"tei_sp_who_wc tei_sp\">\n               <h4 class=\"entry_author\">[Clark]</h4>\n               <span class=\"tei_ab\">\n                  <div class=\"entry_date\">August 18th Sunday 1805\n</div><div class=\"clear_return\">\u00a0</div>\n               </span>\n               <p>\nPurchased of the Indians three horses for which we gave a Chiefs Coat Some Handkerchiefs a Shirt Legins &amp; a fiew arrow points &amp;c.
