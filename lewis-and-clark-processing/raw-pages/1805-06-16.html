I now informed <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt. C.</a> of my discoveries with rispect to the most proper side for our portage, and of it's great length, which I could not estimate at less than 16 miles. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt. C.</a> had already sent two men this morning to examine the country on the S. side of the river; he now passed over with the party to that side and fixed a camp about a mile blow the entrance of a Creek <a href=\"#n15061602\" id=\"ln15061602\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> where there was a sufficient quantity of wood for fuel, an article which can be obtained but in few places in this neighbourhood. \u00a0\u00a0 after discharging the loads four of the canoes were sent back to me, which by means of strong ropes we hawled above the rappid and passed over to the south side from whence the water not being rappid we can readily convey them into the creek by means of which we hope to get them on the high plain with more ease. \u00a0\u00a0 one of the small canoes was left below this rappid in order to pass and repass the river for the purpose of hunting as well as to procure the water of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Sulphur (Sacagawea) Springs\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Sulphur%20%28Sacagawea%29%20Springs\">Sulpher spring</a>, <a href=\"#n15061603\" id=\"ln15061603\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> the virtues of which I now resolved to try on <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Sacagawea\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Sacagawea\">the Indian woman</a>. \u00a0\u00a0 this spring is situated about 200 yards from the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Missouri River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Missouri%20River\">Missouri</a> on the N.

Clark</a> determined to set out in the morning to examine [<em class=\"hi\">NB: the country</em>] and survey the portage, and discover the best rout. \u00a0\u00a0 as the distance was too great to think of transporting the canoes and baggage on the men's shoulders, we scelected six men, and ordered them to look out some timber this evening, and early in the morning to set about making a parsel of truck wheels in order to convey our canoes and baggage over the portage. \u00a0\u00a0 we determined to leave the white perogue at this place, and substitute the Iron boat, and also to make a further deposit of a part of our stores. \u00a0\u00a0 in the evening the men who had been sent out to examine the country and made a very unfavourable report. \u00a0\u00a0 they informed us that the creek just above us and two deep ravenes still higher up cut the plain between the river and mountain in such a manner, that in their opinions a portage for the canoes on this side was impracticable. \u00a0\u00a0 g[o]od or bad we must make the portage. \u00a0\u00a0 notwithstanding this report I am still convinced from the view I had of the country the day before yesterday that a good portage may be had on this side at least much better than on the other, and much nearer also. I found that two dozes of barks and opium which I had given her since my arrival had produced an alteration in her pulse for the better; they were now much fuller and more regular. I caused her to drink the mineral water altogether. \u00a0\u00a0 wen I first came down I found that her pulse were scarcely perceptible, very quick frequently irregular and attended with strong nervous symptoms, that of the twitching of the fingers and leaders of the arm; now the pulse had become regular much fuller and a gentle perspiration had taken place; the nervous symptoms have also in a great measure abated, and she feels herself much freeer from pain. \u00a0\u00a0 she complains principally of the lower region of the abdomen, I therefore continued the cataplasms of barks and laudnumn <a href=\"#n15061605\" id=\"ln15061605\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[5]</sup></a> which had been previously used by my friend <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt Clark</a>. I beleive her disorder originated principally from an obstruction of the mensis in consequence of taking could.\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 I determined to remain at this camp in order to make some celestial observations, restore the sick woman, and have all matters in a state of readiness to commence the portage immediately on the return of <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt.
