The <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Nez Perce Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians\">Chopunnish</a> are in general stout well formed active men. \u00a0\u00a0 they have high noses and many of them on the acqueline order with cheerfull and agreeable countenances; their complexions are not remarkable. \u00a0\u00a0 in common with other savage nations of America they extract their beards but the men do not uniformly extract the hair below, this is more particularly confined to the females. I observed several men among them whom I am convinced if they had shaved their beards instead of extracting it would have been as well supplyed in this particular as any of my countrymen. \u00a0\u00a0 they appear to be cheerfull but not gay; they are fond of gambling and of their amusements which consist principally in shooting their arrows at a bowling target made of willow bark, and in riding and exercising themselves on horseback, racing &amp;c. \u00a0\u00a0 they are expert marksmen and good riders. they do not appear to be so much devoted to baubles as most of the nations we have met with, but seem anxious always to obtain articles of utility, such as knives, axes, tommahawks, kettles blankets and mockerson alls. \u00a0\u00a0 blue beads however may form an exception to this remark; this article among all the nations of this country may be justly compared to goald or silver among civilized nations. They are generally well cloathes in their stile. \u00a0\u00a0 their dress consists of a long shirt which reaches to the middle of thye, long legings which reach as high as the waist, mockersons, and robes. \u00a0\u00a0 these are formed of various skins and are in all rispects like those particularly discribed of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Shoshone Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Shoshone%20Indians\">Shoshones</a>. \u00a0\u00a0 their women also dress like the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Shoshone Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Shoshone%20Indians\">Shoshones</a>. \u00a0\u00a0 their ornaments consist of beads shells and peices of brass variously attatched to their dress, to their ears arrond their necks wrists arms &amp;c. \u00a0\u00a0 a bando of some kind usually surrounds the head, this is most frequently the skin of some fir animal as the fox otter &amp;c. tho' they have them also of dressed skin without the hair. \u00a0\u00a0 the ornament of the nose is a single shell of the wampum. \u00a0\u00a0 the pirl and beads are suspended from the ears. \u00a0\u00a0 beads are woarn arround their wrists necks and over their sholders crosswise in the form of a double sash. \u00a0\u00a0 the hair of the men is cewed in two rolls which hang on each side in front of the body as before discribed of other inhabitants of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Columbia River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Columbia%20River\">Columbia</a>. \u00a0\u00a0 collars of bears claws are also common; but the article of dress on which they appear to bstow most pains and ornaments is a kind of collar or brestplate; this is most comonly a strip of otterskin of about six inches wide taken out of the center of the skin it's whole length including the head. \u00a0\u00a0 this is dressed with the hair on; a hole is cut lengthwise through the skin near the head of the animal sufficiently large to admit the head of the person to pass. \u00a0\u00a0 thus it is placed about the neck and hangs in front of the body the tail frequently reaching below their knees; on this skin in front is attatched peices of pirl, beads, wampum peices of red cloth and in short whatever they conceive most valuable or ornamental. I observed a tippit woarn by <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Hohots Ilppilp\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Hohots%20Ilppilp\">Hoh\u00e2stillpilp</a>, which was formed of human scalps and ornamented with the thumbs and fingers of several men which he had slain in battle. \u00a0\u00a0 their women brade their hair in two tresses which hang in the same position of those of the men. \u00a0\u00a0 they also wear a cap or cup on the head formed of beargrass and cedar bark. \u00a0\u00a0 the men also frequently attatch some small ornament to a small plat of hair on the center of the crown of their heads\n</p>\n            </span>\n         </div>\n         <div class=\"entry lc.jrn.1806-05-13.02 tei_div\" id=\"lc.jrn.1806-05-13.02\">\n            <span class=\"tei_sp_who_wc tei_sp\">\n               <h4 class=\"entry_author\">[Clark]</h4>\n               <span class=\"tei_ab\">\n                  <div class=\"entry_date\">\n                     <em class=\"hi\">Tuesday 13th May 1806.</em>\n                  </div><div class=\"clear_return\">\u00a0</div>\n               </span>\n               <p>\na fine morning \u00a0\u00a0 I administered to the Sick and gave directions. \u00a0\u00a0 we collected all our horses and Set out at 1 P.
