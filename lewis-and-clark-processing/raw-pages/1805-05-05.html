Buffaloe Elk and goats or Antelopes feeding in every direction; we kill whatever we wish, the buffaloe furnish us with fine veal and fat beef, we also have venison and beaver tales when we wish them; the flesh of the Elk and goat are less esteemed, and certainly are inferior. \u00a0\u00a0 we have not been able to take any fish for some time past. The country is as yesterday beatifull in the extreme.\u2014</p>\n               <p>\nsaw the carcases of many Buffaloe lying dead along the shore partially devoured by the wolves and bear. \u00a0\u00a0 saw a great number of white brant also the common brown brant, geese of the common kind and a small species of geese which differ considerably from the common canadian goose; their neck head and beak are considerably thicker shorter and larger than the other in proportion to it's size, they are also more than a third smaller, and their note more like that of the brant or a young goose which has not perfectly acquired his notes, in all other rispects they are the same colour habits and the number of feathers in the tale, they frequently also ascociate with the large geese when in flocks, but never saw them pared off with the large or common goose. <a href=\"#n12050501\" id=\"ln12050501\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> The white brant <a href=\"#n12050502\" id=\"ln12050502\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> ascociate in very large flocks, they do not appear to be mated or pared off as if they intended to raise their young in this quarter, I therefore doubt whether they reside here during the summer for that purpose. this bird is about the size of the common brown brant or two thirds of the common goose, it is not so long by six inches from point to point of the wings when extended as the other; the beak head and neck are also larger and stronger; their beak \u2329and\u232a legs and feet are of a redish or fleshcoloured white. \u00a0\u00a0 the eye is of moderate size, the puple of a deep sea green incircled with a ring of yellowish brown. \u00a0\u00a0 it has sixteen feathers of equal length in the tale; their note differs but little from the common brant, their flesh much the same, and in my opinion preferable to the goose, the flesh is dark. \u00a0\u00a0 they are entirely of a beatifull pure white except the large feathers of the 1st and second joints of the wings which are jut black. \u00a0\u00a0 form and habits are the same with the other brant; they sometimes ascociate and form one common flock. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt [<em class=\"hi\">X: we</em>] Clark</a> found a den of young wolves in the course of his walk today and also saw a great number of those anamals; they are very abundant in this quarter, and are of two species <a href=\"#n12050503\" id=\"ln12050503\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 the small woolf or burrowing dog of the praries are the inhabitants almost invariably of the open plains; they usually ascociate in bands of ten or twelve sometimes more and burrow near some pass or place much frequented by game; not being able alone to take deer or goat they are rarely ever found alone but hunt in bands; they frequently watch and seize their prey near their burrows; in these burrows they raise their young and to them they also resort when pursued; when a person approaches them they frequently bark, their note being precisely that of the small dog. \u00a0\u00a0 they are of an intermediate size between that of the fox and dog, very active fleet and delicately formed; the \u2329years\u232a ears large erect and pointed the head long and pointed more like that of the fox; tale long \u2329and bushey\u232a; the hair and fur also resembles the fox tho' is much coarser and inferior. \u00a0\u00a0 they are of a pale redish brown colour. \u00a0\u00a0 the eye of a deep sea green colour small and piercing. \u00a0\u00a0 their tallons are reather longer than those of the ordinary wolf or that common to the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Atlantic Ocean\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Atlantic%20Ocean\">atlantic</a> states, none of which are to be found in this quarter, nor I believe above the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Platte River (Nebr.)\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Platte%20River%20%28Nebr.%29\">river Plat</a>.\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 The large woolf found here is not as large as those of the atlantic states. \u00a0\u00a0 they were lower and \u2329heaver\u232a thicker made shorter leged. \u00a0\u00a0 their colour which is not effected by the seasons, is a grey or blackish brown and every intermediate shade from that to a creen [cream] coloured white; these wolves resort the woodlands and are also found in the plains, but never take refuge in the ground or burrow so far as I have been able to inform myself. \u00a0\u00a0 we scarcely see a gang of buffaloe without observing a parsel of those faithfull shepherds on their skirts in readiness to take care of the mamed &amp; wounded. \u00a0\u00a0 the large wolf never barks, but howls as those of the atlantic states do. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt. Clark</a> and <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Drouillard, George\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George\">Drewyer</a> killed the largest \u00a0\u00a0 brown bear this evening which we have yet seen. \u00a0\u00a0 it was a most tremendious looking anamal, and extreemly hard to kill notwithstanding he had five balls through his lungs and five others in various parts he swam more than half the distance across the river to a sandbar &amp; it was at least twenty minutes before he died; he did not attempt to attact, but fled and made the most tremendous roaring from the moment he was shot. We had no means of weighing this monster; <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt. Clark</a> thought he would weigh 500 lbs. \u00a0\u00a0 for my own part I think the estimate too small by 100 lbs. \u00a0\u00a0 he measured 8 Feet 7\u00bd Inches from the nose to the extremety of the hind feet, 5 F. 10\u00bd Inch arround the breast, 1 F. 11 I. arround the middle of the arm, &amp; 3 F. 11 I. arround the neck; his tallons which were five in number on each foot were 4\u215c Inches in length. \u00a0\u00a0 he was in good order, we therefore divided him among the party and made them boil the oil and put it in a cask for future uce; the oil is as hard as hogs lard when cool, much more so than that of the black  bear. \u00a0\u00a0 this bear differs from the common black bear in several respects; it's tallons are much longer and more blont, it's tale shorter, it's hair which is of a redish or bey brown, is longer thicker and finer than that of the black bear; his liver lungs and heart are much larger even in proportion with his size; the heart particularly was as large as that of a large Ox. \u00a0\u00a0 his maw was also ten times the size of black bear, and was filled with flesh and fish. \u00a0\u00a0 his testicles were pendant from the belly and placed four inches assunder in seperate bags or pouches.\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 this animal also feeds on roots and almost every species of wild fruit.</p>\n               <p>\nThe party killed two Elk and a Buffaloe today, and my dog caught a goat, which he overtook by superior fleetness, the goat it must be understood was with young and extreemly poor. \u00a0\u00a0 a great number of these goats are devowered by the wolves and bear at this season when they are poor and passing the river from S. W. to N.
