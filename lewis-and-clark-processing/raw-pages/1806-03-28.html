I saw a few of the Canvisback duck. <a href=\"#n31032804\" id=\"ln31032804\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 the duckinmallard are the most abundant. \u00a0\u00a0 one of the hunters killed a duck which appeared to be the male, <a href=\"#n31032805\" id=\"ln31032805\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[5]</sup></a> it was a size less than the duckinmallard. \u00a0\u00a0 the head neck as low as the croop, and back tail and covert of the wings were of a fine black with a small addmixture of perple about the head and neck, the belley &amp; breast were white; some long feathers which lie underneath the wings and cover the thye were of a pale dove colour with fine black specks; the large feathers of the wings of the wings are of a dove colour. \u00a0\u00a0 the legs are dark, the feet are composed of 4 toes each of which there are three in front connected by a web, the 4th is short flat and placed high on the heel behind the leg. \u00a0\u00a0 the tail is composed of 14 short pointed feathers. \u00a0\u00a0 the beak of this duck is remarkably wide, and is 2 inches in length, the upper chap exceeds the under one in both length and width, insomuch that when the beak is closed the under is entirly concealed by the upper chap. \u00a0\u00a0 the tongue, indenture of the margin of the chaps &amp;c. are like those of the mallard. \u00a0\u00a0 the nostrils are large longitudinal and connected. \u00a0\u00a0 a narrow strip of white garnishes the upper part or base of the upper chap; this is succeeded by a pale skye blue colour which occupys about one inch of the chap, is again succeeded by a transverse stripe of white and the extremity is of a pure black. \u00a0\u00a0 the eye is moderately large the puple black and iris of a fine orrange yellow. \u00a0\u00a0 the feathers on the crown of the head are longer than those on the upper part of neck and other parts of the head; these feathers give it the appearance of being crested. \u00a0\u00a0 at \u00bd after ten A. M. it became fair, and we had the canoes which wanted repairing halled out and with the assistance of fires which we had kindled for the purpose dryed them sufficiently to receive the pitch which was immediately put on them; at 3 in the evening we had them compleat and again launched and reloaded. \u00a0\u00a0 we should have set out, but as some of the party whom we had permitted to hunt since we arrived have not yet returned we determined to remain this evening and dry our beding baggage &amp;c. the weather being fair.

We set out early, and at 10 o'clock \ncame to <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Deer (E-lal-lar) Island\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Deer%20%28E-lal-lar%29%20Island\">Deer island</a>; where those who had gone ahead in the small canoes had encamped, and all gone out to hunt except one. In a short time a hunter returned with a large deer, and we concluded to stay here all day and repair two of our canoes, that leaked. It rained at intervals during the day. Our hunters came in and had killed 7 deer in all. Some of the men went to bring in the meat, and others went out and killed some geese and ducks. At the last village we passed I took notice of a difference in the dress of the females, from that of those below, about the coast and <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Baker (Haley's) Bay\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Baker%20%28Haley%27s%29%20Bay\">Hailey's Bay</a>. Instead of the short petticoat, they have a piece of thin dressed skin tied tight round their loins, with a narrow slip coming up between their thighs. On this island there are a greater number of snakes, than I had ever seen in any other place; they appeared almost as numerous as the blades of grass; and are a species of Garter snake. When our men went for the deer, they found that the fowls had devoured four of the carcases entirely, except the bones. So they brought in the other two; and we finished our canoes and put them in the water.
