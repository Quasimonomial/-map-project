but as they are but small game to subsist a party on of our strength I have forbid the men shooting at them as it waists a considerably quantity of amunition and delays our progress. \u00a0\u00a0 we passed <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt. Clark's</a> encampment of the 23rd inst. \u00a0\u00a0 the face of the country &amp; anamal and vegatable productions were the same as yesterday, untill late in the evening, when the valley appeared to termineate and the river was again hemned in on both sides with high caiggy and rocky clifts. <a href=\"#n17072501\" id=\"ln17072501\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 soon after entering these hills or low mountains we passed a number of fine bold springs which burst out underneath the Lard. clifts near the edge of the water; they wer very cold and freestone water. \u00a0\u00a0 we passed a large Crk. today in the plain country, 25 yds. wide, which discharges itself on the Stard. side; it is composed of five streams which unite in the plain at no great distance from the river and have their souces in the Mts. \u00a0\u00a0 this stream we called <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Crow (Gass's) Creek (Mont.)\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Crow%20%28Gass%27s%29%20Creek%20%28Mont.%29\">Gass's Creek</a>. <a href=\"#n17072502\" id=\"ln17072502\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 after <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Gass, Patrick\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick\">Sergt. Patric Gass</a> one of our party.\u2014 \u00a0\u00a0 two rapids near the large spring we passed this evening were the worst we have seen since that we passed on entering the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Rocky Mountains\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains\">rocky Mountain</a>; they were obstructed with sharp pointed rocks, ranges of which extended quite across the river. \u00a0\u00a0 the clifts are formed of a lighter coloured stone than those below \u00a0\u00a0 I obseve some limestone also in the bed of the river which seem to have been brought down by the current as they are generally small and woarn smooth.\u2014 <a href=\"#n17072503\" id=\"ln17072503\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 This morning <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clark, William\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Capt.

I have observed a red as well as a yellow species of goosberry <a href=\"#n17072506\" id=\"ln17072506\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[6]</sup></a> which grows on the rocky Clifts in open places of a swetish pine like flavor, first observed in the neighbourhood of <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Missouri River, Great Falls of the\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Missouri%20River%2C%20Great%20Falls%20of%20the\">the falls</a>; at least the yellow species was first observed there. \u00a0\u00a0 the red differs from it in no particular except it's colour and size being somewhat larger; it is a very indifferent fruit, but as they form a variety of the native fruits of this country I preserved some of their seeds. \u00a0\u00a0 musquetoes and knats troublesome as usual.</p>\n               <div class=\"p\">\n                  <div class=\"tei_table_head\">\n                        <em class=\"hi\">Courses and distances of July 25th 1805.</em>\n                     </div><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class=\" tei_table\">\n                     \n                     <tr class=\" tei_tr\">\n                        <td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\" class=\" tei_td rowspan_1 colspan_1\"><span class=\"cell_contents\">S. 25\u00b0 W.</span></td>\n                        <td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\" class=\" tei_td rowspan_1 colspan_1\"><span class=\"cell_contents\">\u00a0\u00a01</span></td>\n                        <td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\" class=\" tei_td rowspan_1 colspan_1\"><span class=\"cell_contents\">to the center of a Stard. bend</span></td>\n                     </tr>\n                     <tr class=\" tei_tr\">\n                        <td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\" class=\" tei_td rowspan_1 colspan_1\"><span class=\"cell_contents\">S. 10\u00b0 W.</span></td>\n                        <td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\" class=\" tei_td rowspan_1 colspan_1\"><span class=\"cell_contents\">\u00a0\u00a01 \u00bc</span></td>\n                        <td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\" class=\" tei_td rowspan_1 colspan_1\"><span class=\"cell_contents\">to a point in a Stard. bend passing a small Isld.
