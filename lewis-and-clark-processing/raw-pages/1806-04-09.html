here we halted and took breakfast. <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Colter, John\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?people=Colter%2C%20John\">John Colter</a> one of our party observed the tomehawk in one of the lodges which had been stolen from us on the 4th of November last as we decended this river; the natives attempted to wrest the tomahawk from him but he retained it. \u00a0\u00a0 they indeavoured afterwards to exculpate themselves from the odium of having stolen it, they alledged that they had bought it from the natives below; but their neighbours had several days previously, informed us that these people had stolen the Tommehawk and then had it at their village. \u00a0\u00a0 this village appears to be the winter station of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Watlala Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Watlala%20Indians\">Wah-clel-lahs</a> and <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Clahclellar Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Clahclellar%20Indians\">Clahclellars</a>, <a href=\"#n31040902\" id=\"ln31040902\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> the greater part of the former have lately removed to the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Multnomah Falls\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Multnomah%20Falls\">falls of the Multnomah</a>, and the latter have established themselves a few miles above on the North side of the river opposite the lower point of <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Bradford (Brant) Island\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Bradford%20%28Brant%29%20Island\">brant island</a>, <a href=\"#n31040903\" id=\"ln31040903\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> being the commencement of the rapids, here they also take their salmon; they are now in the act of removing, and not only take with them their furniture and effects but also the bark and most of the boards which formed their houses. \u00a0\u00a0 14 houses remain entire but are at this time but thinly inhabited, nine others appear to have been lately removed, and the traces of ten or twelve others of ancient date were to be seen in the rear of their present village. \u00a0\u00a0 they sometimes sink their houses in the earth, and at other times have their floors level with the surface of the earth; they are generally built with boards and covered with Cedar bark. \u00a0\u00a0 most of them have a devision in their houses near the entrance wich is at the end or in the event of it's bing a double house is from the center of a narrow passage. \u00a0\u00a0 several families inhabit one appartment. \u00a0\u00a0 the women of these people piece the cartelage of the nose in which they wear various ornaments in other rispects they do not differ from those in the neighbourhood of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Government (Diamond, White Goose, Swan) Island\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Government%20%28Diamond%2C%20White%20Goose%2C%20Swan%29%20Island\">Diamond island</a>; tho' most of the women brad their hair which hanges in two tresses one hanging over each ear. \u00a0\u00a0 these people were very unfriendly, and seemed illy disposed had our numbers not detered them any acts of violence. \u00a0\u00a0 with some difficuly we obtained five dogs from them and a few wappetoe. \u00a0\u00a0 on our way to this village we passed several beautifull cascades which fell from a great hight over the stupendious rocks which cloles the river on both sides nearly, except a small bottom on the South side in which our hunters were encamped. the most remarkable of these casscades falls about 300 feet perpendicularly over a solid rock into a narrow bottom of the river on the south side. <a href=\"#n31040904\" id=\"ln31040904\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> \u00a0\u00a0 it is a large creek, situated about 5 miles above our encampment of the last evening. \u00a0\u00a0 several small streams fall from a much greater hight, and in their decent become a perfect mist which collecting on the rocks below again become visible and decend a second time in the same manner before they reach the base of the rocks. \u00a0\u00a0 the hills have now become mountains high on each side are rocky steep and covered generally with fir and white cedar. \u00a0\u00a0 we saw some turkey buzzards <a href=\"#n31040905\" id=\"ln31040905\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[5]</sup></a> this morning of the speceis common to the United states which are the first we have seen on this side the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Rocky Mountains\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains\">rocky mountains</a>. \u00a0\u00a0 during our halt at this village the grand Cheif and two inferior Cheifs of the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Wishram-Wasco Indians\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Wishram-Wasco%20Indians\">Chil-luck-kit-te-quaw</a>\n                   <a href=\"#n31040906\" id=\"ln31040906\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[6]</sup></a> nation arrived with several men and women of their nation in two large canoes. \u00a0\u00a0 these people were on their return up the river, having been on a trading voyage to the <a class=\"regularization\" title=\"Columbia River\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" href=\"../search?places=Columbia%20River\">Columbean</a> vally, and were loaded with wappetoe dryed anchovies, with some beads &amp;c which they had received in exchange for dryed and pounded salmon shappelell beargrass &amp;c. <a href=\"#n31040907\" id=\"ln31040907\" class=\"ref_link\"><sup>[7]</sup></a> These people had been very kind to us as we decended the river we therefore smoked with them and treated them with every attention. \u00a0\u00a0 at 2 P.
